    <h1>Seminar: Young tableaux</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to the seminar on <em>Young tableaux in algebra and geometry</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>Basic information</h2>
    <p>
      Our main reference will be the book <strong>Young tableaux: with applications to representation theory and geometry</strong> by <strong>William Fulton</strong> published by the Cambridge University Press (ISBN-13: 978-0521567244).
    </p>
    <p>
      We will meet on <strong>Tuesday, 7PM&ndash;9PM</strong> in <strong>room 508</strong> in the math department.
    </p>

    <h2>Final paper</h2>
    <p>
      You will need to write an expository paper on a topic of your choice. It will be short (no more than 5 pages) and written using LaTeX. A first draft will be due by December 1. I will return it with comments within a week and ask you to submit a revised draft by December 14. If you prefer, you can turn in your draft early, in which case I will return it early with comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The choice of the topic and what you want to write about it is up to you.
      But please keep it within 5 pages.
      This will restrict what you can and cannot do.
      For example, if a theorem has a 10 page long proof, you will have to omit it or only sketch the main idea.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Topic ideas
    </h3>
    <p>
      You can read and summarize one (or part) of the following works.
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li>C. Greene, <em>Some partitions associated with a partially ordered set</em> (Generalizes the notion of largest increasing subsequences to partially ordered sets and relates them to Young tableaux.)
	<li>R. Stanley, <em>Polygon dissections and standard young tableaux</em> (A short paper showing a bijection between certain dissections of an (n+2)-gon and certain Young tableaux.)
	<li>R. Stanley <em>On the enumeration of skew Young tableaux</em> (Exact and asymptotic formulas for number of skew tableaux.)
	<li>C. Krattenthaler <em>Nonintersecting lattice paths and oscillating tableaux</em> (Involves variations of the RSK correspondence for so-called oscillating tableaux.)
	<li>C. Greene, A. Nijenhuis, and H. Wilf <em>A probabilistic proof of a formula for the number of Young tableaux of a given shape </em> (A short probabilistic proof of the Hook length formula).
	<li>I. Gessel and G. Viennot <em>Binomial determinants, paths, and hook-length formulae</em> (Gives determinantal formulae for enumerating Young tableaux).
	<li>R. Stanley <em>A baker's dozen of conjectures concerning plane partitions</em> (Conjectures about enumerating Young tableaux.)
      </ul>
    <p>
      You can discuss the following theorems, formulas, or concepts. 
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Hook length formula 
	<li>Jacobi-Trudi identity
	<li>MacMohan's master theorem (a combinatorics/linear-algebraic result with lots of applications)
	<li>Polya enumeration theorem (gives a counting formula using group actions)
	<li>Schur-Weyl duality (relates representations of the general linear group and the symmetric group)
	<li>Hall-Littlewood polynomials (a family of symmetric functions generalizing Schur functions)
      </ul>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you may choose to pick a related collection of exercises from Fulton's book and present their solutions. However, they must share a coherent theme and you should write them up as a unified paper rather than a series of separate problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you are free to choose any result of your choice and write about it.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Later in the semester, we will need working knowledge of groups (specifically the group of permutations <em>S<sub>n</sub></em> and the group of matrices <em>GL<sub>n</sub>(C)</em>.)
      Here are some resources:
      <ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~richard/teaching/s2015/Group_2.pdf">A crash course in group theory</a> by Prof. Serge Richard of Nagoya University.
	<li><a href="http://people.reed.edu/~iswanson/abstractalgebra.pdf">Notes on Abstract Algebra</a> by Prof. Irena Swanson of Reed College.
	  (There is much more here than we will need, but they are a good reference.)
