- With [[asilata][Asilata Bapat]] and [[tony][Tony Licata]], I am studying [[wiki:Bridgeland_stability_condition][Bridgeland stability conditions]] on some triangulated categories.
- With [[rachel:][Rachel Newton]], [[vaidehee:][Vaidehee Thatte]], and [[rosa:][Rosa Winters]], I am exploring arithmetic ramifications of the geometry of certain [[wiki:Hurwitz_scheme][Hurwitz spaces]].
- [[anandpatel:][Anand Patel]] and I threw every tool we knew at a cool enumerative problem ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14232][counting 3-uple Veronese surfaces]]) whose answer comes out to \(4246\).  We would love a numerical verification, so if you know something about ~bertini~ or homotopy continuation, please write to us.
- Last semester, I taught a course of about 150 students.  I wanted to check if continuous engagement in the course correlates with higher scores on the final, so I did a bit of data science; [[file:teaching/2024ggm/engagement/][see the results]].
- Last semester, I taught a reading course based on Bott and Tu's famous book [[https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-3951-0][Differential forms in algebraic topology]]; see the [[file:teaching/2024bott_tu/final.pdf][take-home final exam]].
- I am supervising Charlie Sherrat, who has been exploring the moduli space of [[wiki:Cubic_surface][cubic surfaces]] arising from 3x3x4 rubik's cubes.

  This is an ongoing project to determine GIT stability for syzygies of genus 7 canonical curves.
  This is the first genus where canonical syzygies define an interesting GIT quotient, so it would be nice to understand the complete picture.

- [[https://github.com/asilata/cobracat][Categorical braid group actions]]\\
  With [[https://asilata.github.io][Asilata Bapat]], I wrote ~Sage~ code to make explicit computations in the homotopy category of projective modules over a ring.
  In particular, this code can compute braid actions on complexes of projective modules over the zig-zag algebra of a quiver.
