CV: [[file:cv.html][html]] [[file:cv.pdf][pdf]]

I am a mathematician working in algebraic geometry and related areas.
I study the interplay between systems of algebraic equations and the geometric shapes they describe.

If you are thinking of doing a PhD with me, please read this [[file:prospective_phd.org][page for prospective PhD students]].

** Upcoming travel:
*** December 2025: Kioloa
*** January 2026: Chennai ([[https://www.birs.ca/events/2026/5-day-workshops/26w5536][BIRS workshop in conformal field theory)]]
*** February 2026: Sydney (Workshop in algebraic geometry at SMRI) 
** With [[asilata][Asilata Bapat]] and [[tony][Tony Licata]], I am studying [[wiki:Bridgeland_stability_condition][Bridgeland stability conditions]] on some triangulated categories.
** With [[rachel:][Rachel Newton]], [[vaidehee:][Vaidehee Thatte]], and [[rosa:][Rosa Winters]], I am exploring arithmetic ramifications of the geometry of certain [[wiki:Hurwitz_scheme][Hurwitz spaces]].
** [[anandpatel:][Anand Patel]] and I threw every tool we knew at a cool enumerative problem ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14232][counting 3-uple Veronese surfaces]]) whose answer comes out to \(4246\).  *UPDATE* [[timduff:][Timothy Duff]] successfully verified this numerically!  
** I just finished teaching a course called /Games, graphs, and machines/.
** Next semester, I will teach Algebra 2 (Fields and Galois Theory).  Given the proliferation of synthetic text generators, I will have to re-think written assignments.  Happy to hear any thoughts! 
** This semester, I organised a working seminar on /Bridgeland stability conditions/ and am going to a working seminar on /Hochschild homology/ organised by [[sveta:][Sveta Makarova]].

- [[file:genus7syz/][GIT for syzygies of genus 7 curves]]\\
  This is an ongoing project to determine GIT stability for syzygies of genus 7 canonical curves.
  This is the first genus where canonical syzygies define an interesting GIT quotient, so it would be nice to understand the complete picture.
  One day...

- [[https://github.com/asilata/cobracat][Categorical braid group actions]]\\
  With [[https://asilata.github.io][Asilata Bapat]], I wrote ~Sage~ code to make explicit computations in the homotopy category of projective modules over a ring.
  In particular, this code can compute braid actions on complexes of projective modules over the zig-zag algebra of a quiver.
