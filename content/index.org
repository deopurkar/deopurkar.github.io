I am an algebraic geometer with broad interests.
Being an algebraic geometer means that I fundamentally study solution spaces of algebraic equations.
I am interested in classical algebraic geometry, enumerative geometry, deformation theory, algebraic stacks, derived categories, among other things.

  An ongoing project to determine GIT stability for syzygies of genus 7 canonical curves.
  This is the first genus where canonical syzygies define an interesting GIT quotient, so it would be nice to understand the complete picture.
  One day...

- [[https://github.com/asilata/cobracat][Categorical braid group actions]]\\ [[https://asilata.github.io][
  Asilata Bapat]] and I wrote ~Sage~ code to make explicit computations in the homotopy category of projective objects.
  In particular, this code can compute braid actions on complexes of projective modules over the zig-zag algebra of a quiver.
