This year, the course will be on algebraic geometry, the study of algebraic equations using geometry and geometric shapes using algebra.
We will begin with affine varieties---solution sets of polynomial equations---and use these as building blocks to construct a rich world of geometric objects that include Riemann surfaces, projective spaces, Grassmannians, etc.

* Announcements
1. The final exam will be on Nov 17 and 18 (with the same rules as the midterm).
2. Here are some [[file:AGFinalPractice.pdf][practice questions]] for the final.

* Links
- Lectures: 1 (Monday 10--11, Moran G007), 2 (Wed 10--11, Moran G008), 3 (Thu 11--12, HN 4.41), 4 (Fri 12--13, Moran G007)
- Zoom lecture: https://anu.zoom.us/j/87920733031 (you know the password)
- Zoom office hours: Thursday 10--11 (same room as the lecture), continuing into Thursday's class.
- Discussion forum: https://ag2021.zulipchat.com.
- The assignments will be due on Gradescope.

* Pre-requisites
Algebra 1 and Algebra 2.

Algebraic geometry interacts deeply with many other areas of mathematics, so some background in topology, complex analysis, and differential geometry will be helpful, but not required. 

* Assessment
The final mark is based on three factors.
1. (50%) Homework + classwork
2. (25%) A mid-semester exam (take-home, in-person, or Zoom)
3. (25%) A final exam (take-home, in-person, or Zoom)
The classwork will consist of progress reports and the associated write-up, each equivalent to 1 homework set.
If you are a masters student or taking the course as an ASC/ASE, your assessment will include an additional project component.

** Classwork
The format of our classwork will be as follows. The first meeting of the week (Monday) will be a traditional lecture in which I will explain the key ideas of a topic, but not prove all the details. In the following two meetings (Wednesday, Thursday), we will work out the details in small groups. By the end of Thursday, you will write a "progress report" (a 1-2 sentence summary of your progress for each question) and submit it on Gradescope. On Friday, based on the progress reports, I will present the solutions. Students (selected at random) will write up the solutions and send them to me in a week. I will add the write-ups to [[file:notes][our notes]]. 

* Policies
** Late submission
I will not accept any late submissions, except for medical emergencies with a medical certificate.
To compensate for this strict policy, I will drop the lowest among the (homework+classwork) marks.

** Collaboration
You are allowed, even encouraged, to work with others on homework assignments, but you must write up your solutions *on your own*. In other words, you *may not* copy someone else's write-up and you *may not* write your solutions side by side with someone else. On your submission, you must write the names of your collaborators. This is a matter of academic honesty; it will not affect your marks. 

There will be no collaboration on the exams.
