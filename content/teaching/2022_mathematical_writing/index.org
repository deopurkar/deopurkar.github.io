#+title: The language of mathematics, 2022 Semester 1
#+author: Anand Deopurkar
The aim of this course is to develop written and oral communication skills in mathematics.
Through weekly readings, discussions, and presentations we will learn
- how to write mathematics clearly and coherently,
- how to use symbols and equations within mathematical text,
- how to structure and present arguments,
- how to organise long mathematical documents,
- how to present ideas clearly and effectively.

* Structure of the course
We will meet twice a week, on Tuesday from 12 to 1:30 and Thursday from 2 to 3:30.
One meeting will be devoted to writing and one to oral presentation.
In the meeting about writing, we will review the week's reading, do in-class exercises, and discuss the writing assignment.
In the meeting about presentation, one or two students will give short talks, and we will discuss various aspects of presentation raised by the talks.

1. Tuesdays 12 to 1:30, MSI Board Room (HN 2.48) - presentation
2. Thursdays 2 to 3:30, MSI Board Room (HN 2.48) - writing

* Assessment
The mark will be based on class participation (10%), writing assignments (60%), and in-class presentations (30%).  

* Resources
- Francesco Vivaldi, /Mathematical Writing for Undergraduate Students/ (Required textbook)
- Primer, University of Michigan, /Demonstration, Proof beyond the possibility of doubt/ ([[http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~smdbackr/MATH/Mathematical_Writing_A_Primer.pdf][Online textbook]])

* Rough plan for the writing component
1. Weeks 1-3 : Fundamentals
2. Weeks 4-6 : Writing proofs
3. Weeks 7-9 : Micro writing (small-scale issues)
4. Weeks 10-12 : Macro writing (large-scale issues)

* Collaboration and late policy
You may collaborate with others, but *everything you submit must be your own work*.  That is, you must write your own submissions, and not copy it from anywhere else.  If you get any outside help, you *must acknowledge it* by writing (for example) "I worked with ... and ... for this homework."  Or "I took help from ... website for this homework".  Failing to do this is a form of academic dishonesty.

Late homework will be penalised at 10\% of the grade per day, for a maximum of 3 days, after which it will receive a score of 0.  The exception is if you ask me for an extension *in writing* (email is fine) at least *24 hours before* the deadline.

* Detailed weekly plan

**** Be clear!
- Takes time and a lot of effort.
- If you do not take the time to be clear:
  - you lose readers,
  - you lose a chance to make an impact,
  - people do not take you seriously,
  - you disadvantage yourself.
- Ignore the rules when they make the math unclear.
**** Where to start
- Good guide on writing nonfiction.
**** Macro tips
***** Title
- Super important
- Try different versions on your colleagues
- First approximation to the contents of your paper
***** Abstract
- Easiest section to write.
- Nothing personal, just dry facts.
- Rule of thumb: 0.3-0.5 times the number of pages.
***** Introduction
- This is the hardest section to write.
- Main theorem on the first page, or at most the second page.
- In the last paragraph, outline the structure of the paper in your own words.
**** Micro tips
- Basic grammar, syntax, punctuation
- Don't be pedantic

1. *Say something*
   - Two ways in which writing can be bad: no ideas or too many.

2. *Speak to someone*
   - Keep a particular reader in mind.

3. *Organize first*
   - Make an outline
   - An outline in which every discussion, lemma, theorem, corollary, remark, and proof are mentioned.  And these appear in an order that is logically correct and psychologically digestible.

4. *Think about the alphabet*
   - Good notation.
     For example, either \(ax+by\) or \(a_1x_1+a_2x_{2}\) is preferable to \(ax_1+bx_2\).

5. *Write in spirals*
   - 1; 2, 1, 2; 3, 1, 2, 3; 4, 1, 2, 3, 4 ...
   - While revising, do not edit but rewrite.

6. *Organize always*

7. *Write good english*
   - Write in currently and commonly accepted style.

8. *Honesty is the best policy*
   - If you are using a theorem without proof, say so.
   - If you are using a mathematical concept without defining it, say so.
   - Do not hide the status of your statements.  
     Whenever you tell the reader something, tell where it stands: this has been proved, this hasn't, this will be proved, that won't.

9. *Down with the irrelevant and the trivial*
   - Don't ramble on and then suddenly announce "Thus we have proved that ..."  State the result first, and then prove it.
   - Leave chit-chat out of the statement of the theorem.

10. *Do and do not repeat*

11. *The editorial We is not all bad*

12. *Use words correctly*
    - Correct quantifiers.  Avoid 'any'; use 'each' or 'every'.
    - Write 'if', 'then', 'for all', 'there exist' rather than logical symbols.

13. *Use technical terms correctly*

14. *Resist symbols*

15. *Use symbols correctly*

This is a longer writing assignment.
The first draft is due in Week 8, and a revised draft is due in Week 9.  Your mark will be based only on the revised draft.

Write a 1 to 2 page paper about the content of your first talk.
Include a title and one or two short introductory paragraphs.
Your write-up must contain at least one definition, one example, and one result with proof.
See "6. Types of Mathematical Results" and "7. Definitions" in Keith Conrad's document.
For this assignment, you do not have to include references, and it is OK to not divide your document into sections.

* Comments on presentations (updating list)
Many of these comments also apply to clear writing.
** General
1. Make eye contact with the audience as much as possible.  Avoid speaking to the board.
2. Speak so that everyone can hear clearly (not too softly or too fast).
3. Begin informally, before going into technical details.
4. Motivate your topic.  Get the readers interested in what you are saying.
5. Keep the talk focused.  Do not try to do everything.
   Some strategies to keep focus: making simplifying assumptions, doing special cases, explaining by an example.
** Board/slides
1. Write the title.
2. Write legibly, clearly, in sufficiently big font.
3. Develop the habit of speaking when you writing, avoiding long silences.
4. Use the board to write the important points, not as a place for scratch work.
** Content
1. Illustrate definitions with examples and non-examples.  Comment on edge cases.
2. Give precise definitions.  If that is not possible, explicitly indicate what is left vague or undefined.
3. Mention each non-trivial mathematical result you use.  Indicate if it is easy or difficult.  Give proper attribution.
4. Take every opportunity to draw a picture.
5. Take every (reasonable) opportunity to tell a story.
** Notation
1. Use consistent notation, and alert the audience if notation changes.
** Handouts
1. Keep consistent with the talk.
2. Comment on everything that is in the handout.

* General comments on the first paper
** Introduction

The introduction to your paper must answer the following two questions
1. What is the paper about?
2. Why should the readers care?
Number (2) is harder to achieve and takes practice.
Number (1) is easier.
To achieve (1), your introduction should explain the main topic and the main results.
After reading the introduction, the reader should not be surprised by anything that comes later.

** Body
Use the appropriate LaTeX environments for definitions, theorems etc.  
For example, put the theorems in \begin{theorem} ... \end{theorem} and the proofs in \begin{proof}...\end{proof}.

The body must be more than just a sequence of definitions and theorems. 
You must provide guides to the reader, by periodically reminding them what has been done and what comes ahead.
You can do this by including sentences like:
- Having defined eigenvectors and eigenvalues, we now see how to compute them.
- We are now ready to state the main theorem.
- Before we state the main theorem, we need some notation.
- We have finished proving the lemma; now we turn to the proof of the theorem.

All major definitions and theorems should come with an introductory sentence.

For example, before you state a theorem in \begin{theorem}...\end{theorem}, include a sentence like:
- The following is the main theorem of the paper.
- Having established the notation, we state the main theorem.
- The following theorem states that solutions exist and are unique.

Before you give a major definition in \begin{definition}...\end{definition}, include a sentence like:
- We now give the precise definition.
- The following is the key definition of the paper.

Before an example, include a sentence that explains why you are including the example.
For example:
- The following example shows that the solution is not always unique.
- We now give an example of a continuous function that is not differentiable.
- Not all matrices admit an eigenvector, as the following example shows.

An introductory sentence is also helpful for minor definitions and theorems, but in those cases, it is more acceptable to skip.
