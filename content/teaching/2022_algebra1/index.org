This course is an introduction to the world of abstract algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and fields.  In addition to learning the mathematical content, we will also hone our skills in writing clear and concise proofs.  The assessment will reflect the demonstrated mastery of the content and the skills.

1. Let \(p\) consist of a 2-cycle and no other non-trivial cycles.
   (This kind of permutation is called a transposition).
   Show that \(\operatorname{sgn}(p) = -1\).

2. Let \(p\) consist of an \(n\)-cycle and no other non-trivial cycles.
   Express \(p\) as a product of transpositions, and hence find \(\operatorname{sgn}(p)\).

3. Prove that every permutation can be expressed as a product of transpositions.
   Convince yourself that this expression is not unique, even the number of factors can change.
   But something about it is unique; what is it?

4. The alternating group \(A_n \subset S_n\) is the subgroup consisting of permutations of sign \(1\).

A polyethylene molecule is a long chain of carbon and hydrogen atoms that looks like this:

#+downloaded: screenshot @ 2022-08-11 12:18:09
[[file:assets/Workshops/2022-08-11_12-18-09_screenshot.png]]

The central spine of carbon atoms (black) forms a zigzag, which we take to extend infinitely in both directions.
Let us say that the carbon atoms lie in the \(x,y\)-plane; their \(x\)-coordinates are integers; and their \(y\)-coordinates are \(\pm 1\).

Let \(G\) be the group of symmetries (isometries) of the planar carbon spine (ignoring the hydrogens).
Then \(G\) contains the following kinds of elements, for every \(n \in \mathbf{Z}\):
- Reflections \(f_{n}\) :: in the vertical line \(x = n\),
- 180 rotations \(r_{n}\) :: centered at the point \((n + 1/2, 0)\),
- Glides \(g_{n}\) :: reflection in the \(y\)-axis followed by an \(x\)-translation by \(2n+1\),
- Translations \(t_{n}\) :: traslations in the \(x\)-axis by \(2n\).


1. Write each transformation in the form
   \[ X \mapsto AX + B\]
   where \(A\) is a \(2 \times 2\) matrix.\\
   /Hint: There are only 4 possible \(A\)'s:/
   \[
      \begin{pmatrix} \pm 1 & \\ & \pm 1 \end{pmatrix}.
      \]

2. Using your description (or by pure imagination!), complete the following multiplication table.
   By convention, the entry in row \(r\) and column \(c\) is the transformation \(r \circ c\).
   |     | f_n | r_n | g_n | t_n |
   |-----+-----+-----+-----+-----|
   | f_m |     |     |     |     |
   | r_m |     |     |     |     |
   | g_m |     |     |     |     |
   | t_m |     |     |     |     |

3. Let \(N \subset G\) be the subgroup consisting of the translations.  
   Show that it is a normal subgroup.
   Can you identify \(G/N\)?
   Its multiplication table is hidden in the table above!

The goal of this workshop is to play with generators and relations.

1. Construct an isomorphism \(\langle a \rangle \to \mathbf{Z}\).
2. Prove that the free group \(\langle a, b \rangle\) is not abelian. (The same holds for free groups on more than 2 generators.)
3. Let \(N \subset \langle a, b \rangle\) be the smallest normal subgroup that contains \(a^3, b^2, ab\).
   Prove that \(N\) is the entire free group, and so \(G/N\) is trivial.
   That is, we have
   \[ \langle a, b \mid a^3, b^2, ab \rangle = \{1\}.\]
4. Let \(N \subset \langle a, b \rangle\) be the smallest normal subgroup that contains \(a^3, b^2\).
   Prove that there exists a homomorphism
   \[ G/N \to \operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbf{Z})\]
   that sends \(\overline a\) to \(\begin{pmatrix}0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overline b\) to \(\begin{pmatrix}1 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\).
   1. From this, conclude that \(G/N\) is not trivial.
   2. Also conclude that \(\overline{ab} \in G/N\)  has infinite order.
5. In (3), change the relations to \(a^3, b^3, ab\).  Is the resulting group \(G/N\) trivial?

   2. Remember the definition of a unit.   What are the units in \(R\)?

      \[ R \to \mathbf{R}\]
      defined by \(f \mapsto f(0.1)\) is a ring homomorphism.

2. Let \(R = \mathbf{Z}[x]/(x^2 + 1)\).

We continue thinking about quotient rings.  

Let \(F\) be a field.
Recall that all ideals of \(F[x]\) are principal, namely, of the form \(p(x)F[x]\)  for some \(p(x) \in F\).
(The ideal \((f_1,\dots, f_n)R\) is often denoted by \(\langle f_1,\dots,f_n \rangle\), when the ambient ring \(R\) is clear from the context.)
Also recall that an ideal \(I\) is called /maximal/ if \(I\) is not the unit ideal, and the only ideals containing \(I\) are \(I\) and the unit ideal.

1. Why are all ideals of \(F[x]\) principal?  Given an ideal \(I \subset F[x]\), how will you find a generator \(p(x)\)?
2. When is \(I = \langle p(x) \rangle\) a maximal ideal?
3. What are the maximal ideals of \(\mathbf{C}[x]\)?  Of \(\mathbf{R}[x]\)?

Determine if the following ring is a field or not a field.  
If it is not a field, find a non-zero element that does not have a multiplicative inverse.
It may be useful to simplify the given description by taking quotients in stages.

1. \(\mathbf{F}_5[x]/(x^2+1)/\)
2. \(\mathbf{Z}[x]/(3x-1, x^2+x+1)\)

The goal of this workshop is to explore \(F[t]\)-modules.

Let \(F\) be a field.
For concreteness, you can take \(F = \mathbf{Q}\)  or \(\mathbf{R}\) or your favourite field.

1. Give an example of a non-zero \(F[t]\)-module.
2. Convince your friends that an \(F[t]\)-module is automatically an \(F\)-vector space.
3. Give an example of an \(F[t]\)-module that is 2-dimensional as an \(F\)-vector space.
   Is your module a free \(F[t]\)-module?
4. Let \(V\) be an \(F[t]\)-module.
   Consider the map \(A \colon V \to V\) defined by \(Av = t v\).
   Prove that \(A\) is an \(F\)-linear map of vector spaces.
5. Express the map \(A\) in your example as a \(2 \times 2\) matrix.
6. Conversely, let \(V\) be an \(F\)-vector space and \(A \colon V \to V\) an \(F\)-linear map.
   Show that there is a unique \(F[t]\)-module structure on \(V\) such that for all \(v \in V\), we have \(A v = t v\).

   **Slogan**: An \(F[t]\)-module is "the same as" an \(F\)-vector space and an endomorphism.

7. What should be the slogan for an \(F[s,t]\)-module? (Caution: It is trickier than you might think.)

*Remark*: In a principal ideal domain \(R\), we have a reasonable definition of gcd.
Given \(f, g \in R\), we consider the ideal \((f,g)R\), which must be of the form \(hR\) for some \(h \in R\). This \(h\) is not necessarily unique, but it is unique up to multiplying by a unit, and we call it the gcd of \(f\) and \(g\).

Let \(I \subset A\) be the set
\[I = \{f \in A \mid \text{there exists } \epsilon > 0 \text{ such that } f(x) = 0 \text{ for all } x \in [-\epsilon, \epsilon]\}.\]
1. Prove that \(I \subset A\) is an ideal.
2. Prove that \(I \neq (f_1,\dots, f_{n})A\) for any \(n\) and any \(f_1, \dots, f_n \in A\).

**Remark**: We say that a ring is /Noetherian/ if all its ideals are finitely generated.  For example, \(\mathbf{Z}\) and all fields are Noetherian.
Any quotient of a Noetherian ring is Noetherian, and a polynomial ring (in finitely many variables) over a Noetherian ring is Noetherian.
As a result, many of the rings we encounter in algebra are Noetherian.
