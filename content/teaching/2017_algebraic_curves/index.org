#+title: Math 8820 (Algebraic curves), Fall 2017

The goal of the class is to learn the theory of complex algebraic curves or Riemann surfaces.
We will use Rick Miranda's book titled "Algebraic curves and Riemann surfaces."
The calendar below shows the tentative plan of the course.
As we get to the end of this plan, we can decide upon what to do next based on what strikes our fancy.
Possible further topics include:

1. Singular curves and degeneration techniques.
2. Moduli spaces.
3. Curves over finite fields and the Weil conjectures.

Here is the [[file:syllabus.pdf][official course syllabus]].

* Homework

Work out the problems in enough detail to convince yourself that you understand what is going on, but you need not turn in any write-up, unless you require a grade.
If you require a grade, then you must write up complete solutions to at least 20 problems over the course of the semester.
