* Course information
Welcome to algebra 2!  In this course, we will learn use the machinary of abstract algebra to understand numbers, equations, and functions.

- Textbook :: Algebra (2nd edition) by Michael Artin (Chapters 12, 15, 16).
- Assessment :: 5% reflective check-ins, 5% workshop participation, 30% homework, 30% midterm, 30% final.

The weekly workload of the course is as follows:
- Reading :: I will assign roughly 10 pages to read from Artin.  To guide your reading, I will provide a list of accompanying questions.  As you read, I expect you to solidify your understanding by trying these questions (you do not have to submit, write-up, or present these answers).
- Reflective check-in :: By Tuesday night, you will complete a reflective check-in on Wattle.  It will consist of one question: What part of the reading you found most difficult?  As long as you submit a response, you will get credit (no right or wrong answers).
- Lectures :: Wednesday and Friday's lectures will be about the assigned reading and will focus on the most difficult parts.
- Workshop :: Monday/Tuesday's workshop will be about the content from last week (starting week 2).
- Homework :: Due on Fridays.  Will be on the material from last week (starting week 2).

If you are enrolled in the 6000-version of the course, in addition to the homework you will complete 2 mini-projects.
The 30% homework weight will be split as 20% homework + 10% mini-projects.
A mini-project will be like an extended homework that goes deeper into some aspect of the course.

*Collaboration policy* :: For the reading, the accompanying questions, and the workshop questions, I encourage you to work with others.  For the homework, please work individually at first and only then work with others.  The write-ups must be your own.  As a matter of academic honesty, please write the names of your collaborators on your submissions (this will have no effect on your marks).

*Use of computers* :: Using computational algebra software is acceptable as long as you can independently justify the answers, and unless explicitly forbidden.  I recommend against consulting large language models (ChatGPT etc) for mathematical questions.  But if you do, you must (a) explicitly acknowledge its use, like listing your collaborator and (b) provide a transcript of the conversation.

     Where does this process go wrong in \(\mathbf{Z}[x]\)?

  6. [Just before Proposition 12.2.19]  Why does \(\mathbf{R}[x]\) not have irreducible polynomials of degree \(> 2\)?

  7. [Eq 12.3.1]

   Is \(x^p-x = 0\) in \(R[x]\)?

5. Convince yourself that a ring homomorphism \(R[x] \to S\) is the same thing as a ring homomorphism \(R \to S\) and an element of \(S\) that serves as the image of \(x\).

   That is, given a ring homomorphism \(\psi \colon R \to S\) and an element \(s \in S\), there is a unique ring homomorphism \(R[x] \to S\) which agrees with \(\psi\) on degree zero polynomials and sends \(x\) to \(s\).

6. Consider \(z - xy \in \mathbf{C}[x,y,z]\).

  1. [Theorem 12.5.2]
     Write down Gauss primes of absolute value up to 5.

  2. [Diagram 12.5.4]
     Spend time really understanding this diagram.
     Convince yourself that this is just the last isomorphism stated in the Correspondence Theorem (Theorem 11.4.3), sometimes called the "third isomorphism theorem" for quotients.

  3. [Diagram 12.5.4]
     What can you say about the ring \(\overline R\) for \(p = 3\)? For \(p = 5\)?

  4. [Section 15.1]
     Convince yourself that \(\mathbf{Z}[i]/3\) is a finite field.
     How many elements does it have?
     What is the multiplicative inverse of 2? Of \(1+i\)?

     What is the minimal polynomial of \(\sqrt 2\) over \(\mathbf{Q}\)?

  6. [Proposition 15.2.3]
     Let \(\alpha = e^{i\pi/4}\).

     1. What is "the canonical map \(F[x]/(f) \to F[\alpha]\)"?
     2. Is \(\mathbf{Q}[\pi] = \mathbf{Q}(\pi)\)?
     3. How does the analogue of Proposition 15.2.6 work with more variables?
     For example, what is the kernel of the map
     \[ \mathbf{Q}[x,y,z] \to \mathbf{Q}[\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3, \sqrt 6]\]
     that sends \(x\) to \(\sqrt 2\) and \(y\) to \(\sqrt 3\) and \(z\) to \(\sqrt 6\)?

  8. [Propositions 15.2.8]
     1. Is there an isomorphism from \(\mathbf{Q}[\sqrt 2]\) to \(\mathbf{Q}[1 + \sqrt 2]\)?
     2. Write down two extensions of \(\mathbf{Q}\) of degree 2 that are not isomorphic.
        How do you know they are not isomorphic?
*** Workshop 3
**** Minimal polynomials and presentations
1. Let \(F = \mathbf{Q}[2^{1/6}]\).
   Find the kernel of the map \(\mathbf{Q}[x] \to F\) that sends \(x\) to \(2^{1/6}\).

2. Let \(\zeta\) be a sixth root of unity. 
   Is \(\mathbf{Q}[2^{1/6}] = \mathbf{Q}[2^{1/6} \cdot \zeta]\)?

**** Eisenstein primes
Let \(\omega = e^{2\pi i /3}\).
By following the same logic as for \(\mathbf{Z}[i]\) in class, we can describe the primes of \(\mathbf{Z}[\omega]\).

1. Consider the map \(\mathbf{Z}[x] \to \mathbf{Z}[\omega]\) that sends \(x\) to \(\omega\).
   Show that the kernel of this map is the principal ideal generated by \(x^2+x+1\).

2. Let \((\pi) \subset \mathbf{Z}[\omega]\) be a non-zero prime ideal.
   Prove that its pre-image in \(\mathbf{Z}\) is a non-zero prime ideal.
   Convince yourself that this says that every prime \(\pi \in \mathbf{Z}[\omega]\) divides a unique prime number \(p \in \mathbf{Z}\).

3. Establish bijections between
   1. prime ideals in \(\mathbf{Z}[\omega]\) containing \(p\),

5. Experiment with the factorisation of \(x^2+x+1\) in \(\mathbf{F}_p[x]\) for various primes \(p\).
   Do you see a pattern?

** Week 4
- Reading for week 4 :: 15.3, 15.4, 15.5
- Questions to think about :: 
  1. [Definition of degree]
     Write a basis of \(\mathbf{Q}[2^{1/3}]\) as a \(\mathbf{Q}\)-vector space.
  2. [Proposition 15.3.3]
     Where does the proof fail in characteristic 2?
  3. [Corollary 15.3.8]
     Consider \(K = \mathbf{Q}[\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3]\).
     What can you say about its degree over \(\mathbf{Q}\)?
     What will you need to prove to prove that its degree over \(\mathbf{Q}\) is 4?
  4. [Examples 15.4.1, 15.4.4]
     Convince yourselves that \(\mathbf{Q}[\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3] = \mathbf{Q}[\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3]\).
  5. [Lemma 15.4.2]
     Are the \(d_1d_2\) monomials \(\alpha^i\beta^j\) always linearly independent?
     Construct an example where they are not.
  6. [Lemma 15.5.8]
     "This polynomial is irreducible over \(\mathbf{Q}\) because it has no integer root."
     Unpack this.
*** Workshop 4
1. How would you prove that \(\sqrt 3 \not \in \mathbf{Q}[\sqrt 2]\)?
   The most simple minded way is to prove that for no \(a, b \in \mathbf{Q}\), we have \((a+b\sqrt 2)^2 = 3\).
   Here is another way that uses the concept of conjugates.
   We say that \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbf{C}\) are /conjugates/ over \(\mathbf{Q}\) if for every \(p(x) \in \mathbf{Q}[x]\), if \(p(\alpha) = 0\) then \(p(\beta) = 0\) and vice versa.
   Equivalently, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are conjugates over \(\mathbf{Q}\) if they have the same minimal polynomial over \(\mathbf{Q}\).

   1. Prove that \(a+b \sqrt 2\) and \(a-b \sqrt 2\) are conjugates over \(\mathbf{Q}\).
   2. Suppose \(\sqrt 3 = a + b \sqrt 2\).
      Take \(p(x) = x^2-3\) in the definition of conjugates.
      What do you get?
      (You should get that \(a = 0\) or \(b = 0\), but \(b = 0 \) is impossible, so \(a = 0\)).
   3. Finally, conclude that there is no rational number \(b\) such that \(\sqrt 3 = b \sqrt 2\).

2. Here is a version of the above problem that might help in the homework.
   Let \(\zeta_3 = e^{2\pi i/3}\).
   For \(a,b,c \in \mathbf{Q}\), prove that \(a + b 2^{1/3} + c 2^{2/3}\) and \(a + b \zeta_3 2^{1/3} + \zeta_3^2 2^{2/3}\) are conjugates over \(\mathbf{Q}\).

   /Hint/: Use the presentation \(\mathbf{Q}[t]/(t^3-2)\) for \(\mathbf{Q}[2^{1/3}]\) and \(\mathbf{Q}[2^{1/3} \zeta_3]\).

3. Let \(\gamma = \sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3\).
   1. Prove that \(\mathbf{Q}[\gamma] = \mathbf{Q}[\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3]\).
      Call this field \(K\).
   2. Prove that \(1, \gamma, \gamma^2, \gamma^3\) and \(1, \sqrt 2, \sqrt 3, \sqrt 6\) are both bases of \(K\) as a \(\mathbf{Q}\)-vector space.
      Write down the change-of-basis matrix.

1. For which \(m, n \in \mathbf{Z}\) is the ring \(\mathbf{Q}[x,y]/(x^2-m, y^2-n)\) a field?
2. Exercise 15.7.8.
*** Workshop 5
**** Finite fields and bit strings
Let \(F = \mathbf{F}_2[a]/(a^4+a+1)\).
Note that \(1, a, a^2, a^3\) is a basis of \(F\) as an \(\mathbf{F}_2\) vector space.
So we can represent every element of \(F\) uniquely as \(b_0 + b_1 a + b_2 a^2 + b_3 a^3\), where \(b_0,\dots, b_3 \in \mathbf{F}_2\).

1. We abbreviate \(b_0 + b_1 a + b_2 a^2 + b_3 a^3\) by the bit-string \(b_0b_1b_2b_3\).
   Then the elements of \(F\) are represented by the 16 strings \(0000,0001,0010,\dots, 1111\).
   Explain the addition law of \(F\) in terms of bit-strings.
2. Describe multiplication by \(a\) in terms of bit-strings.
3. Sometimes, instead of writing the 4 bit-strings, people write the integer they represent in binary notation, for exmaple, writing "14" for the bit-string "1110".
   Then the elements of \(F\) become the more familiar symbols \(0, \cdots, 15\) (for example, \(a^3 + a^2 + a\) will be "14").
   1. Show that this representation conflicts with our convention that the integer symbol \(n\) represents the image of \(n\) under the unique homomorphism from \(\mathbf{Z}\).
   2. Show that this representation respects neither the addition nor the multiplication law.
**** Finite fields and frobenius
Again, \(F\) is \(\mathbf{F}_2[a]/(a^4+a+1)\) of size \(2^4\).
Let \(\phi \colon F \to F\) be the Frobenius automorphism.

1. We know that \(F\) contains a field of size \(2^2\).
   How do we find it?
   Prove that the only subfield of size 4 in \(F\) consists of the set of elements \(x \in F\) such that \(\phi(\phi(x)) = x\).
   Find such 4 elements.

2. Each of the other 12 elements of \(F\) must have degree 4 over \(\mathbf{F}_2\).
   There are 3 irreducible polynomials of degree 4 in \(\mathbf{F}_2[x]\), namely \(x^4+x+1\), \(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1\), and \(x^4+x^3+1\).
   Group the 12 elements by their minimal polynomial (there should be 3 groups of 4).

3. Recall that two elements of \(F\) are conjugate over \(\mathbf{F}_2\) if they have the same minimal polynomial over \(\mathbf{F}_2\).
   The grouping above is the grouping of elements of \(F\) into conjugate quadruples.
   Verify that the following is true.

   *Proposition*: Let \(F\) be a finite field of characteristic \(p\), and let \(\alpha \in F\) be an element of degree \(r\) over \(\mathbf{F}_p\).  Let \(\phi \colon F \to F\) be the Frobenius.  Then the conjugates of \(\alpha\) are \(\alpha, \phi(\alpha), \phi(\phi(\alpha)), \cdots, \phi^{r-1}(\alpha)\).

4. Prove the above proposition (in general, not just for the given field).
** Week 6
- Reading for week 6 :: 15.8, 15.10
- Questions to think about :: 
  1. [Proof of 15.8.1]
     Recall why the roots of an irreducible polynomial are distinct in characteristic 0?
     Can you construct an example where this fails in positive characteristic?
  2. [Proof of 15.8.1]
     For which values of \(c\) is \(\sqrt 2 + c \sqrt 3\) a primitive element of \(\mathbf{Q}[\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3]\)?
  3. [Theorem 15.10.1]
     What does the fundamental theorem of algebra say about the maximal ideals of \(\mathbf{C}[x]\)?

     There is a generalisation of the fundamental theorem of algebra to multivariate polynomial rings, called Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.
     It says that every maximal ideal of \(\mathbf{C}[x_1,\dots, x_n]\) is of the form \((x_1-a_1, \cdots, x_n-a_n)\) for some \(a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbf{C}\).
*** Homework 6
*Homework 6* :: Due on *Friday 18 April 2025 by 11:59pm* on [[https://www.gradescope.com/courses/991392][Gradescope]].

1. Exercise 15.10.1.
   Recall that an algebraic number in \(\mathbf{C}\) is one that is algebraic over \(\mathbf{Q}\).

2. Exercise 15.M.3.
   Let us make this question a bit more precise.
   What are the possible degrees of the irreducible factors of \(f\) in \(K[x]\)?
   That is, for each \(d \in \{1,\cdots, 6\}\), determine whether \(d\) is possible as a degree of an irreducible factor of \(f \in K[x]\).
   If you say that a degree \(d\) is possible, please give an example of an \(F\), a \(K\), and an \(f\) such that \(f \in K[x]\) has an irreducible factor of degree \(d\).
   If you say that a degree \(d\) is not possible, please explain why.

   We can ask for a refinement of this question (but you do not have to do this).
   The factorisation of \(f \in K[x]\) gives a partition of 6.
   For example, if \(f\) factors into two linear factors and two quadratic factors, we have the partition \(6 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2\).
   What are the possible partitions of 6?

Due on *Friday 2 May 2025 by 11:59pm* on [[https://www.gradescope.com/courses/991392][Gradescope]].

The goal of this mini-project is to explore the factorisation of prime numbers in cyclotomic rings.

Let \(\zeta_n = e^{2\pi i / n}\).
The \(n\)-th /cyclotomic ring/ is the ring \(\mathbf{Z}[\zeta_n]\).

1. Let \(p\) be an integer prime number.
   Consider the map \(\mathbf{Z}[x] \to \mathbf{Z}[\zeta_p]\) that sends \(x\) to \(\zeta_p\).
   Find the kernel of this map.
   Justify your answer.

2. Let \(\ell\) be an integer prime number.
   Prove that \(\ell\) is prime in \(\mathbf{Z}[\zeta_p]\) if and only if the polynomial \(x^{p-1} + \cdots + 1\) is irreducible in \(\mathbf{F}_{\ell}[x]\).
   For \(p = 5\), give examples of integer primes \(\ell\) that are also primes in \(\mathbf{Z}[\zeta_p]\) and those that are not primes in \(\mathbf{Z}[\zeta_p]\).
   (At least 3 examples of each kind).

3. Suppose \(\ell \neq p\).
   Prove that \(x^{p-1} + \cdots + 1\) is reducible in \(\mathbf{F}_{\ell}[x]\) if and only if \(p\) divides \(\ell^{n} - 1\) for some positive integer \(n < p-1\).
   Observe (but do not write-up) that this statement is equivalent to: \(x^{p-1}+\cdots+1\) is irreducible in \(\mathbf{F}_{\ell}[x]\) if and only if the order of \(\ell\) in \(\mathbf{F}_{p}^{\times}\) is \((p-1)\).

4. This problem involves doing experiments using a computer.  You may use a program of your choice (my choice is ~sage~, which has many mathematical algorithms built-in).  Ask me for help if you need it.  
   You do not need to prove any of your results.
   As justification for your answers, include a copy of your code or pseudo-code.

   1. Fix a small prime \(p\) (one or two digits).
      Consider all primes \(\ell\) up to a large number \(N\).
      - What proportion of \(\ell\) are such that \(\ell\) has order \((p-1)\) in \(\mathbf{F}_p^{\times}\)?
      - Where do these numbers converge as \(N \to \infty\)?
      - Does the limiting value seem to depend on \(p\)?
      - (Optional, do not turn in) Can you guess the limiting value in terms of \(p\)?  (Hint: it involves Euler's totient function applied to \(p-1\)).

   2. Fix a small prime \(\ell\) (one or two digits).
      Consider al primes \(p\) up to a large number \(N\). 
      - What proportion of \(p\) are such that \(\ell\) has order \((p-1)\) in \(\mathbf{F}_p^{\times}\)?
      - Where do these numbers seem to converge as \(N \to \infty\)?
      - Does the limiting value seem to depend on \(\ell\)?
      - (Optional, do not turn in) The phenomenon here has to do with an open problem called /Artin's conjecture/ (named after Emil Artin, the father of Michael Artin, who is the author of our textbook).  Look it up on the internet and see if your answer matches the conjecture.
*** Mini project 2
Due on *Friday 23 May 2025 by 11:59pm* on [[https://www.gradescope.com/courses/991392][Gradescope]].

The goal of this project is to explore the inverse Galois problem.
This problem asks whether given a finite group \(G\), we can find a finite Galois extension \(\mathbf{Q} \subset K\) such that \(\operatorname{Gal}(K/ \mathbf{Q})\) is isomorphic to \(G\).

1. Let \(p\) be a prime number and let \(G = \mathbf{Z}/ (p-1) \mathbf{Z}\).
   Find an isomorphism
   \[ G \to \operatorname{Gal}(\mathbf{Q}(\zeta_p)/ \mathbf{Q}).\]

2. Let \(n\) be an integer that divides \(p-1\) for some prime number \(p\).
   Find a finite Galois extension \(K\) of \(\mathbf{Q}\) such that \(\operatorname{Gal}(K/ \mathbf{Q})\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z} / n \mathbf{Z}\).

   Given \(n\), there always exists a prime number \(p\) such that \(n\) divides \(p-1\).
   So the construction above takes care of all cyclic Galois groups.

3. Let us explore a more quantitative version of the inverse Galois problem: for polynomials of degree \(n\), how frequently is the Galois group equal to the full symmetric group \(S_n\)?
   Gather some numerical data.

   1. Fix \(n\).
   2. Let \(P_{n,N}\) be the set of monic polynomials of degree \(n\) with coefficients in \(\{-N,-N+1, \cdots, N-1, N\}\).
      What fraction of the elements of \(P_{n,N}\) have Galois group equal to \(S_n\)?
   3. Does there seem to be a limiting value as \(N \to \infty\)?
   4. In (2), checking all polynomials may be computationally infeasible.
      An alternate approach is to pick a large number of samples from \(P_{n,N}\) uniformly randomly, and to calculate the fraction that have Galois group \(S_n\).
      If the sample size is large enough, then this fraction should be very close to the value we want.

   Based on the data, can you make a conjecture?

   In your response, include
   1. the code/pseudo-code that you used to generate the data,
   2. the data itself,
   3. any conjecture(s).

   You may use the following piece of ~sage~ code that checks whether a given degree \(n\) polynomial has Galois group \(S_{n}\).
   #+begin_src sage exports :both
     S = QQ[x]
     def is_galois_group_full(p):
         n = S(p).degree()
         return S(p).is_irreducible() and S(p).galois_group().order() == factorial(n)

     # Tests
     is_galois_group_full(x^3-3*x+1) #false
     is_galois_group_full(x^4-1) #false
     is_galois_group_full(x^3+3*x+1) #true
   #+end_src
** Week 7
- Week 7 :: 
     No reading this week because of the midterm.
     On Friday, I will give an overview of the main theorem of Galois theory.
     Understanding this will be our goal for the rest of the semester.
*** Homework 7
*Homework 7* :: Due on *Friday 25 Apr 2025 by 11:59pm* on [[https://www.gradescope.com/courses/991392][Gradescope]].

1. Prove that the map
   \[ \mathbf{Q}[x,y]/(x^2-2, y^3-3) \to \mathbf{Q}[\sqrt 2, \sqrt[3]{3}]\]
   that sends \(x\) to \(\sqrt 2\) and \(y\) to \(\sqrt[3]{3}\) (and is the identity on \(\mathbf{Q}\))
   is an isomorphism.

2. Describe all automorphisms of the field \(\mathbf{Q}[\sqrt 2, \sqrt[3]{3}]\).
   (An automorphism is an isomorphism to itself).

   Recall that any automorphism must be the identity on \(\mathbf{Q}\) (convince yourself that this is the case, but do not include its proof in your write-up.)
*** Workshop 6
The goal of this workshop is to see the connection between field automorphisms and algebraic relations satisfied by the roots as alluded in the lecture.

Let \(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_4\) be the roots of \(x^4-2 = 0\).
Let \(K = \mathbf{Q}[\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_4] \subset \mathbf{C}\).

1. Prove that any automorphism of \(K\) must permute the \(\alpha_i\).

2. Using the above, conclude that we have an injective map \(\operatorname{Aut}(K) \to S_4\).

3. What is the image of this map?  That is, which permutations of the roots arise from automorphisms of the field?

   The answer is closely tied to /polynomial relations among the roots/.
   Suppose
   \[\alpha_1 = 2^{1/4}, \quad \alpha_2 = 2^{1/4} i, \quad \alpha_3 = -2^{1/4}, \quad \alpha_4 = -2^{1/4}i.\]
   Observe that we have the relation \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_3 = 0\) but not the relation \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_{4} = 0\).
   Conclude that the polynomial \((34)\) cannot be in the image of \(\operatorname{Aut}(K)\).

4. Let us find all possible polynomial relations in the roots.
   This is simply the kernel of the map
   \[ \mathbf{Q}[x_1, \dots, x_4] \to K\]
   that sends \(x_i\) to \(\alpha_i\).
   Let us ask the computer to find it:
   #+begin_src sage :exports both
     K = QQ[i+2^(1/4)]
     S.<x1,x2,x3,x4> = PolynomialRing(QQ,4)
     f = S.hom([2^(1/4), i*2^(1/4), -2^(1/4), -i*2^(1/4)],K)
     f.kernel()
   #+end_src

   #+results: 
   : Ideal (x2 + x4, x1 + x3, x3^2 + x4^2, x4^4 - 2)

   Now that you know the kernel, rule out some other permutations.

5. It is more efficient to find \(\operatorname{Aut} K\) using another presentation.
   We have the presentation \(\mathbf{Q}[x,y]/(x^2+1, y^4-2) \to K\) given by \(x \mapsto i\) and \(y \mapsto 2^{1/4}\).
   (Assume for now that this map is an isomorphism, and later convince yourselves that this is indeed the case).
   Use this presentation to conclude that \(\operatorname{Aut} K\) has 8 elements.
   Describe them by how they act on \(i\) and \(2^{1/4}\).
   Use this description to pin down the 8 permutations of \(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_{4}\) arising from \(\operatorname{Aut} K\).
** Week 8
- Reading for week 8 :: 16.1, 16.2, 16.3
- Questions to think about :: 
  1. [Definition of symmetric polynomials]
     - Construct some symmetric polynomials in \(\mathbf{Z}[x,y]\) and some non-symmetric ones.
     - In \(\mathbf{Z}[x,y,z]\), construct a polynomial
       - whose orbit has size 2 under \(S_3\)
       - whose orbit has size 3 under \(S_3\)
  2. [Symmetric functions theorem] Write \(x^3+y^3\) as a polynomial in \(x+y\) and \(xy\).
  3. [Symmetric functions theorem]
     This is how we will use this theorem most often.
     Let \(\alpha, \beta\) be two roots of \(x^2 + x + 3\).
     Find the value of \(\alpha^3 + \beta^3\) (without using a computer; use the previous exercise).
  4. [The discriminant]
     Search online for an expression of the discriminant of higher degree polynomials in terms of their coefficients.
  5. [Splitting theorem]
     Is \(\mathbf{Q} \subset \mathbf{Q}[2^{1/3}]\) a splitting field (of some polynomial)?  Why/why not?
     If not, construct a splitting field that contains \(\mathbf{Q}[2^{1/3}]\).

*** Homework 8
*Homework 8* :: Due on *Friday 2 May 2025 by 11:59pm* on [[https://www.gradescope.com/courses/991392][Gradescope]].

1. Exercise 16.3.2: (b) and (c)

2. Let \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\) be the four complex roots of the irreducible polynomial \(x^4-4x+2 \in \mathbf{Q}[x]\).
   Find the minimal polynomial of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2+\alpha_3\alpha_4\) over \(\mathbf{Q}\).

   For this problem, you may need to rewrite symmetric functions in terms of elementary symmetric functions.  See the workshop for a quick tutorial.
*** Workshop 7
1. Find the degrees of the splitting fields of:
   1. \(x^3-2\) over \(\mathbf{Q}\)
   2. \(x^3-t\) over \(\mathbf{C}(t)\)

2. In all the examples above, let \(K/F\) be the splitting field.
   Find a nice presentation of \(K\) over \(F\).
   (That is, write \(K = F[x_1, \dots, x_n] / I\) for an explicit ideal \(I\).)

3. We can express any symmetric expression in the roots in terms of the coefficients, which allows us to find its precise value.
   For an asymmetric expression, we can find the value up to a finite ambiguity.
   Here is an example.
   Let \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3\) be the roots of \(f(x) = x^3+2x-2\), and let \(\alpha = \alpha_1\alpha_2-\alpha_3\).
   The \(S_3\) orbit of the expression \(x_1x_2-x_3\) contains 2 other expressions: \(x_1x_3-x_2\) and \(x_2x_3-x_1\).
   Let \(\beta = \alpha_1\alpha_3 - \alpha_2\) and \(\gamma = \alpha_2\alpha_3-\alpha_1\).

   1. Prove that \((x-\alpha)(x-\beta)(x-\gamma)\) has coefficients in \(\mathbf{Q}\).
   2. Find these coefficients.  You have then narrowed down \(\alpha\) to 3 possible values.

      To do this, you will have to rewrite symmetric polynomials in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials.  Here is an example of how to do that in ~sage~.
      Remember that you can copy/paste and evaluate sage code at https://sagecell.sagemath.org/.
      #+begin_src sage :exports both
        S.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3)
        E = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).elementary()
        E.from_polynomial((x*y-z)*(x*z-y)*(y*z-x))  #Modify for your polynomial.
      #+end_src

      #+results: 
      : e[2, 2] - e[3] - 2*e[3, 1] - e[3, 1, 1] + 2*e[3, 2] + e[3, 3] +
      : 2*e[4] + e[4, 1] - 2*e[4, 2] - 5*e[5] + 2*e[5, 1] - 2*e[6]


      Explanation of notation:
      - \(e[i]\) is the \(i\)-th elementary symmetric polynomial \(e_i\).
      - \(e[i,j]\) is \(e_i \cdot e_j\), and so on.
      - Since we only have 3 variables, \(e_{4}\) and above are zero.
        So, the expression ~sage~ gave reduces to
        \[e_2^2 - e_3 - 2 e_3e_1 + e_3e_1^2 +  2 e_3e_2 + e_3^2.\]

      You don't have to use ~sage~.  Feel free to use whatever method (including computation by hand).  And, of course, I do not expect you to do this kind of heavy computation on an exam.
** Week 9
- Reading for week 9 :: 16.4, 16.5
- Questions to think about :: 
  1. Give examples and non-examples of Galois extensions of \(\mathbf{Q}\).
  2. [Lemma 16.4.2] Try proving this by yourself.  We have seen all the ingredients.
  3. [Theorem 16.4.2] Remember that all fields in this section onwards are of characteristic 0.
     Where in the proof of Theorem 16.5.2 did we use the characteristic 0 assumption?
  4. Let \(K = \mathbf{C}(t)\) and let \(H = \mathbf{Z}/2 \mathbf{Z}\) act on \(K\) so that the generator sends \(t\) to \(-t\).  What is \(K^{H}\)?  What is the minimal polynomial of \(t\) over \(K^{H}\)?
  5. [Example 16.5.5] What if you drop \(\tau\) and only consider the action by \(\sigma\).
     Then we have an action of \(H = \mathbf{Z}/4 \mathbf{Z}\) (very similar to the previous problem).
     What is the fixed field?

*** Workshop 8
The goal of the workshop is to see the main theorem of Galois theory in action in a moderately complicated example.

Let \(K = \mathbf{Q}[3^{1/4},i]\).
This is the splitting field of \(x^4-3\), and has the presentation
\[ \mathbf{Q}[x,y]/(x^4-3, y^2+1) \to K,\]
where the map above sends \(x\) to \(3^{1/4}\) and \(y\) to \(i\).

1. Use the presentation above to find \(\operatorname{Aut}(K/ \mathbf{Q})\).
2. Find an isomorphism from the dihedral group \(D_4\) to \(\operatorname{Aut}(K / \mathbf{Q})\).
3. Write the subgroup diagram for \(D_4\): a vertex for each subgroup and an arrow for each inclusion.
4. For each group in the subgroup diagram, find the fixed field.

The main theorem of Galois theory says that these are all the fields containing \(\mathbf{Q}\) and contained in \(K\).   
*** Homework 9
*Homework 9* :: Due on *Friday 7 May 2025 by 11:59pm* on [[https://www.gradescope.com/courses/991392][Gradescope]].

1. Let \(p\) be a prime number and let \(F = \mathbf{Q}[e^{2\pi i /p}]\).
   Let \(K\) be the splitting field of \(x^p-2\) over \(F\).
   Describe all elements of \(\operatorname{Aut}(K/F)\).
   Describe a group isomorphism  \(\mathbf{Z}/p \mathbf{Z} \to \operatorname{Aut}(K/F)\).

2. Consider the automorphisms \(\sigma\)and \(\tau\) of \(\mathbf{C}(t)\) that fix \(\mathbf{C}\) and act on \(t\) as follows:
   \[ \sigma (t) = e^{2\pi i/n} t, \text{ and } \tau (t) = t^{-1}.\]
   Then \(\sigma\) and \(\tau\) generate the dihedral group \(D_{n}\).
   (Convince yourselves that this is the case, but you do not have to include a proof in your write-up.)

   Find the fixed field \(\mathbf{C}(t)^{D_n}\).
** Week 10
- Reading for week 10 :: 16.6, 16.7
- Tips for reading :: 
     This section contains the statements of the major theorems of Galois theory.
     Your first goal should be to understand these statements.

     Take an example: \(F = \mathbf{Q}\) and \(K = \mathbf{Q}[2^{1/3}, \zeta_3]\).
  1. Prove that this a Galois extension.  Can you prove it in different ways?
  2. What does Lemma 16.6.2 say for this extension?
  3. What does Lemma 16.6.3 say for this extension?
  4. Are the proerties in Theorem 16.6.4 evident here?  Are some less evident than others?
  5. Can you explain the action mentioned in Theorem 16.6.6 in this example?
  6. Can you write down the correspondence asserted in Theorem 16.7.1 in this example?
  7. Do you see Theorem 16.7.5 in this example?

*Homework 10* :: Due on *Friday 16 May 2025 by 11:59pm* on [[https://www.gradescope.com/courses/991392][Gradescope]].

1. Find an example, with justification, of fields
   \[ F \subset K \subset L,\]
   such that \(F \subset K\) and \(K \subset L\) are both Galois extensions, but \(F \subset L\) is not a Galois extension.

2. Let \(\alpha \in \mathbf{C}\) be a root of \(p(x) = x^4 + x + 1\).
   It turns out that \(p(x) \in \mathbf{Q}[x]\) is irreducible and the Galois group of its splitting field is \(S_4\) (you do not have to prove either of these).

   Prove that there is no field \(K\) with
   \[\mathbf{Q} \subsetneq K \subsetneq \mathbf{Q}(\alpha).\]
*** Workshop 9
The goal of this workshop is to use Galois theory to settle the question of ruler/compass constructions.
We say that \(x \in \mathbf{C}\) is /constructible/ if it lies in a tower of quadratic extensions.
That is, if there exist fields
\[ \mathbf{Q} \subset K_1 \subset K_2 \subset \cdots \subset K_n,\]
where each \(K_i \subset K_{i+1}\) is a degree 2 extension and \(\alpha \in K_n\).
Let us prove the following.

\bigskip

\noindent
*Theorem*. A number \(x \in \mathbf{C}\) is constructible if and only if its Galois group (= the Galois group of the splitting field of its minimal polynomial) has order \(2^m\) for some \(m\).

\bigskip

Let us prove the if part.
Suppose \(z\) is constructible.
It is enough to construct a Galois extension (= splitting field) that contains \(z\) and whose degree over \(\mathbf{Q}\) is a power of 2.

1. Suppose \(z = \sqrt {2 + \sqrt 3}\).
   Construct a Galois extension (= splitting field) that contains \(z\) and whose degree over \(\mathbf{Q}\) is a power of 2.
2. Do the same for \(\sqrt{2 + \sqrt {3 + \sqrt 5}}\).
3. Try to formalise the pattern you see.
   This is a bit tricky.  
   One clean way is to prove the following by induction: there exists field \(K'_i\) containing \(K_i\) such that (a) \(K'_i/ \mathbf{Q}\) is Galois and (b) the degree of \(K'_i / \mathbf{Q}\) is a power of 2.


Let us now try the converse.
Suppose \(z\) lies in a Galois extension of degree \(2^{m}\) over \(\mathbf{Q}\).
Let \(G\) be the Galois group.

1. Here is a fact from group theory: a group of order \(2^m\) has a subgroup of order \(2^{m-1}\).  Use it to produce a chain of subgroups of size \(1,2,\cdots, 2^m\).
2. Apply the main theorem of Galois theory.
** Week 11
- Reading for week 11 :: 16.8, 16.9, 16.10
- Tips for reading :: 
     There are no major results from now on.
     Everything is a further illustration of the main theorem of Galois theory.
     But understanding these helps solidify the main theorem.

  - [Theorem 16.8.5] Try to prove the theorem yourself.
  - [Examples 16.9.2] I find these more confusing than illuminating.
    Feel free to skip them.
  - [Proposition 16.9.5/6] If you understood the cubic, then there is nothing new here.
  - [Proposition 16.9.8] Again, the proof of this is not much harder than that of Proposition 16.9.5/6.
    But this proposition is usable only we can write down the resolvent cubic.
    This is possible, in principle, because the coefficients of the resolvent cubic are symmetric expressions in the roots of the original quartic.
    You can try to find it yourself or ask the internet.
  - [Proposition 16.10.2] We have seen examples of this in class already, so hopefully there is nothing surprising here.
    It is worth going through a moderately complicated example.
    Try reading the \(p = 17\) example in Artin or work out a smaller example by yourself.
  - [Theorem 16.10.12] Proving this in general is optional.  Do it if you find it enjoyable.  Otherwise, feel free to give it a pass.

*Homework 11* :: Due on *Friday 23 May 2025 by 11:59pm* on [[https://www.gradescope.com/courses/991392][Gradescope]].

1. By following the procedure in the book for the quintic, find a polynomial of degree \(7\) in \(\mathbf{Q}[x]\) whose Galois group is \(S_7\).

2. A /simple/ group is a group that has no normal subgroups other than the identity and the group itself.
   For example, for a prime \(p\), the group \(\mathbf{Z}/p \mathbf{Z}\) is simple, and these are the only simple abelian groups.
   There are many non-abelian finite simple groups.
   In a massive undertaking in the later half of the last century, many mathematicians working together found out /all/ finite simple groups.
   The picture below (from wikipedia) lists them.

   Let \(f(x) \in \mathbf{Q}[x]\) be a polynomial whose Galois group over \(\mathbf{Q}\) is a non-abelian simple group \(G\).
   Let \(\mathbf{Q} \subset K\) be a Galois extension with Galois group \(\mathbf{Z}/ p \mathbf{Z}\).
   Prove that the Galois group of \(f(x)\) over \(K\) is also \(G\).

1. Prove that \(\mathbf{C}(t) \subset K\) is a Galois extension.
2. Does there exist \(\delta \in \mathbf{K}\) with \(\delta \not \in \mathbf{C}(t)\) such that \(\delta^3 \in \mathbf{C}(t)\)?
   If so, how does one find such a \(\delta\) (in terms of the 3 roots of \(x^3-3tx-t^{2}-t\) in \(K\))?
   How would you compute \(\delta^3 \in \mathbf{C}(t)\) if you had to (in principle)?
**** Galois group after a field extension
Let \(F\) be a subfield of \(\mathbf{C}\) and \(p(x) \in F[x]\)
Let \(F \subset K\) be a Galois extension with group \(H\).
Let \(G_1\) be the Galois group of \(p(x)\) over \(F\) and \(G_2\) the Galois group of \(p(x)\) over \(K\).

What is the relationship between \(G_1\), \(G_2\), and \(H\)?

In particular, describe an injective homomorphism from \(G_2\) to \(G_1\).
Under what conditions is it also surjective?

  1. [Theorem 16.11.1] Artin says the proof is "nice" (which is true), but it is also subtle.
     It uses some non-trivial linear algebra on \(\sigma\).
     To get a sense of what is happening, try doing an example.
     Let \(K = \mathbf{Q}[2^{1/3}, \omega]\).
     Fix a basis of \(K\) over \(\mathbf{Q}\).
     Choose an automorphism \(\sigma\) of \(K\), and write it in this basis.

  2. As Artin says, you can leave out Proposition 16.12.2 if you are happy to take (b) as the definition of solvable.
