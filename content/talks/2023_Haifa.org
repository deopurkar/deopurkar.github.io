* Introduction                                                     :lecture1:
Let \(\mathcal C\) be a triangulated category.
We know that associated to \(\mathcal{C}\) is a manifold \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C})\) that parametrises the set of Bridgeland stability conditions on \(\mathcal{C}\).
The main question I want to address is the following.
#+name: qmain
#+begin_question
What is the global geometry of \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C})\)?
#+end_question
** Motivation
Question~[[qmain]] has significant implications to many longstanding and well-studied open questions.
I will now describe two such implications.
The first concerns \(D^b\operatorname{Coh}X)\), and spefically the case where \(X\) is a K3 surface.
The second concerns a question in group theory that a priori has nothing to do with derived categories or even triangulated categories.

Both applications have to do with understanding symmetries of a triangulated category \(\mathcal{C}\).
By a symmetry of \(\mathcal{C}\), I mean an exact auto-equivalence, namely an exact functor 
\[\phi \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}\]
which is an equivalence of categories.
The set of /auto-equivalences of \(\mathcal{C}\)/ modulo natural isomorphisms forms a group under composition, say \(G\).
The action of \(G\) on \(\mathcal{C}\) induces an action on \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C})\).
The first situation---a group acting on a category---is exotic; the second situation---a group acting on a manifold---is more familiar.
So we may hope to say something about \(G\) and its action on \(\mathcal{C}\) by studying how it acts on \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C})\).
This is precisely how the applications arise.
*** First application: auto-equivalences of DbCoh
Let \(\mathcal{C} = D^{b}(\operatorname{Coh} X)\), where \(X\) is a smooth projective variety over \(\mathbf{C}\).
This is a \(\mathbf{C}\)-linear triangulated category, and we will only be studying \(\mathbf{C}\)-linear auto-equivalences.
As before, set \(G = \operatorname{Aut}(\mathcal{C})\).
What can we say about \(G\)?

We can think of some obvious elements of \(G\):
1. any automorphism \(\phi colon X \to X\) induces \(\phi_{*} \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}\).
2. the shift functor,
3. tensoring by a line bundle,

*Theorem* (Orlov 2002, [cite:@orl:02]) --- If \(\omega_X\) is ample or anti-ample, then the three types of auto-equivalences above generate the full auto-equivalence group \(G\).

For abelian varieties, the auto-equivalence group is larger, but it is completely understood, again due to the work of Orlov [cite:@orl:02].

The case of (true) Calabi--Yau varieties is much more mysterious.
It is made much more complicated by the presence of spherical objects and spherical twists, which we now explain.
*** Spherical objects and spherical twists
Let \(\mathcal{C}\) be the derived category of coherent sheaves on a K3 surface.
Serre duality implies that \(\mathcal{C}\) is a \(2\)-Calabi--Yau category, that is, we have functorial isomorphisms
\[ \Hom(x,y) = \Hom(y,x[2])^{*}.\]


*Definition* --- We say that \(x \in \mathcal{C}\) is /spherical/ if the graded endomorphism algebra of \(x\) is isomorphic to the cohomology algebra of the 2-sphere, that is,
\[ \Hom(x,x) \cong k \quad \Hom^2(x,x) \cong k\]
and all other \(\Hom(x,x[i]) = 0.\)

*Examples* --- In \(D^b(\operatorname{Coh} K3)\), all line bundles are spherical objects.

Every spherical object \(x \in \mathcal{C}\) gives rise to an auto-equivalence
\[ T_x \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}.\]
One way to describe it is as a Fourier--Mukai transform.
In \(D^{b}(X \times X)\), consider the map
\[ x \boxtimes x^\vee \to O_{\Delta},\]
and let \(E_{x}\) be the cone:
\[ x \boxtimes x^\vee \to O_{\Delta} \to E \xrightarrow{+1}.\]
Then \(T_{x}\) is the Fourier--Mukai transform with kernel \(E_{x}\).

As an aside, note that the definition of \(T_{x}\) makes sense for any object \(x\), not just a spherical object.
However, when \(x\) is a spherical object, \(T_x\) is an auto-equivalence.

It is instructive to see how \(T_x\) acts on the Grothendieck group.
Set \(\Lambda = K(\mathbf{C})\).
This is a free \(\mathbf{Z}\)-module of finite rank, equipped with a symmetric bilinear form
\[ \langle [x],[y]\rangle = \sum_{i} \dim \Hom(x,y[i]). \]
Let \(x \in \mathcal{C}\) and set \(v = [x]\).
Let \(T_{x} \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}\) be the Fourier--Mukai transform in the kernel \(E_{x}\) as defined above.
Then we have an endomorphism of the lattice \(\Lambda\) defined by
\[T_{x} \colon w \mapsto w - \langle v,w \rangle v. \]
If \(x\) is spherical, then \(\langle v, v \rangle = 2\), so the formula above is equal to
\[ T_x \colon w \mapsto w - 2 \frac{\langle v, w \rangle}{\langle v, v \rangle} v.\]
If you have recently studied Linear Algebra, then you will recognise that this is the reflection in the hyperplane perperdicular to \(v\).
So, \(T_{x} \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}\) is a lift of a reflection of \(\Lambda\).
Unlike a reflection, however, \(T_{x}\) does not have order 2.
It is easy to check that
\[ T_x \colon x \mapsto x [-1].\]
So no power of \(T_{x}\) is the identity.
In particular, \(T_{x}^{2}\) is a non-trivial auto-equivalence of \(\mathcal{C}\) that is trivial on the Grothendieck group.
The existence of such transformations is a hurdle in understanding the auto-equivalence group.

Let \(H \subset \operatorname{Aut}(\mathcal{C})\) be the kernel of the map
\[ \operatorname{Aut}(\mathcal{C}) \to \operatorname{Aut}(K(\mathcal{C})).\]
Understanding \(H\) is the key step in understanding \(\operatorname{Aut}(\mathcal{C})\).
The image is a linear algebraic object, and is quite well understood.

*Theorem* (Bayer--Bridgeland) ---  Let \(X\) be an algebraic K3 surface of Picard rank 1, set \(\mathcal{C} = D^{b}(\operatorname{Coh} X)\), and let \(H\) be as above.
Then \(H\) is a product
\[ H = \mathbf{Z} \times \text{Free group generated by \(T_{x}^2\) for spherical \(x\)}.\]
The \(\mathbf{Z}\) factor is generated by the shift \([2]\).

It is conjectured, more generally, that \(H\) is generated by \([2]\) and \(T_x^{2}\) for spherical \(x\).

The new ingredient in the proof is the global geometry of \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C})\).
The theorem follows immediately from known results and the following.

*Theorem* (Bayer--Bridgeland) --- In the above setting, \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C})\) is contractible.
*** Spherical twists and braid groups
I am now moving to a story that has nothing to do with derived categories.
In the previous story, the spherical twists were the villains---they complicated the story.
In this story, they are the heroes---they make things work!

Let \(\Gamma\) be a simple graph.
The /Artin-Tits braid group/ associated to \(\Gamma\) is the group \(B_{\Gamma}\) genarated by symbols \(\sigma_{v}\) for each vertex \(v \in \Gamma\) and relations
\[ \sigma_v \sigma_w = \sigma_w \sigma_v \text{ if \(v\) and \(w\) are not connected by an edge},\]
and
\[ \sigma_v \sigma_w \sigma_v = \sigma_w \sigma_v \sigma_w \text{ if \(v\) and \(w\) are connected by an edge}.\]
For example, if \(\Gamma\) is the chain with \(n\)-edges, then \(B_{\Gamma}\) is the usual braid group.

Fundamental questions about the group theory and representation theory of these groups are open.

One of the most important such questions is: does \(B_{\Gamma}\) have a solvable word problem?  That is, is there an algorithm that takes a word in the generators and their inverses as an input and determines whether the word is equal to the identity in the group or not.

Another important question is: does \(B_{\Gamma}\) admits a faithful finite dimensional linear representation?

A positive answer to the second question will give a positive answer to the first question.
If you can represent the group using matrices, then determining whether a word is trivial or not is trivial.
You just have to do matrix multiplication.
But at present we do not know whether a faithful linear representation exists.
Worse, there are no candidate linear representations that we think should be faithful!

But one does not need a faithful linear representation to solve the word problem.
/Any/ good (= computable) faithful representation will do.
Spherical twists provide potential such representations.

The key observation is the following.
Suppose \(x, y \in \mathcal{C}\) are spherical objects.
If \(\hom(x,y) = 0\), then
\[ T_x T_y = T_y T_x.\]
On the other hand, if \(\hom(x,y) = 1\), then
\[ T_xT_yT_x = T_yT_{x}T_{y}.\]
As a result, if we find a configuration of spherical objects whose hom relationships are as in the graph \(\Gamma\), then the map
\[ \sigma_{x} \mapsto T_x\]
provides a /categorical/ representation of \(B_{\Gamma}\).
There are two questions:
1. How do we find categories that admit a \(\Gamma\)-like collection of spherical objects?
2. How do we prove that the representation is faithful?

The first question has been solved.
For every \(\Gamma\), we can write down explicit \(2\)-CY categories \(\mathcal{C}_{\Gamma}\) that have a \(\Gamma\)-collection of spherical objects.
The construction is contained in a collection of papers by Huerfano, Khovanov, Seidel, Thomas.
You can read an expository account in one place in my paper with Bapat and Licata. 
The construction of \(\mathcal{C}_{\Gamma}\) and the action of the braid group \(B_{\Gamma}\) is computable.
In fact, on my laptop I have code that does the computations.

In some cases, the category has an algebro-geometric description.
For example, take \(\Gamma\) to be a chain with \(n\) edges.
Let \(Y\) be the \(A_n\) surface singularity
\[ y^2 - x^{n+1}. \]
Let \(f \colon X \to Y\) be minimal resolution.
The exceptional locus of \(f\) consists of a chain of \(\mathbf{P}^1\)'s, say
\[E_{1} \cup E_2 \cup \cdots \cup E_n.\]
Let \(P_i = O_{E_i}(-1)\) and let \(\mathcal{C} \subset D^b(\operatorname{Coh} X)\) be the full triangulated subcategory generated by the \(P_i\).
Relative Serre duality, together with the fact that \(\omega_f\) is trivial, implies that \(\mathcal{C}\) is a \(2\)-Calabi--Yau category.
It is also not hard to check that each \(P_i \in \mathcal{C}\) is spherical and for \(i \neq j\) we have
\[ \hom(P_i, P_j[1]) = 1\]
if \(|i-j| = 1\).
All the other hom spaces are zero.
In other words, \(P_{1}, \dots, P_n\) form a \(\Gamma\)-like collection of spherical objects.
The resulting action of the Braid group on \(\mathcal{C}\) is known to be faithful.

For dynkin graphs of type \(D\) and \(E\), we can mimic the same construction, using minimal resolutions of singularities of the respective types.

For general graphs, we can do a (non-commutative) algebraic construction.
Given \(\Gamma\), one can construct an explicit dg-algebra \(Z_{\Gamma}\) such the triangulated category of dg-modules over \(Z_{\Gamma}\) contains a \(\Gamma\)-like collection of spherical objects \(P_i\).
If we let \(\mathcal{C}_{\Gamma} \subset Z_{\Gamma}-\operatorname{mod}\) be the full triangulated subcategory generated by the \(P_i\), then it is a 2-Calabi--Yau category that admits an action of \(B_{\Gamma}\) by spherical twists.
The Grothendieck group \(\Lambda\) of \(\mathcal{C}_{\Gamma}\) is the free-abelian group generated by \([P_i]\) and the pairing is given by
\begin{equation}
\langle P_i, P_j\rangle =
 \begin{cases}
 2 & \text{ if } i = j \\
 -1 & \text{ if } i \neq j \text{ are connected by an edge}, \\
 0 & \text{ otherwise}.
 \end{cases}
\end{equation}
This is sometimes called the Coxeter lattice associated to \(\Gamma\).

Let us come to the second question.
How does one prove that the action is faithful?
The action of \(B_{\Gamma}\) on \(\mathcal{C}_{\Gamma}\) induces an action of \(B_{\Gamma}\) on \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C}_{\Gamma})\).
Remember that we have the central charge map
\[ Z \colon \operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C}_{\Gamma}) \to \Hom(\Lambda, \mathcal{C}).\]

*Theorem* (Ikeda) -- The image of \(Z\) an open set \(U\) with \(\pi_1(U) = B_{\Gamma}\).
The action of \(B_{\Gamma}\) on \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C}_{\Gamma})\) by spherical twists coincides with the action by deck transformations.

(There is a similar theorem for K3 surfaces which is used in the proof of Bayer and Bridgeland.)

Thanks to the theorem, we see that the action of \(B_{\Gamma}\) on \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C}_{\Gamma})\) is faithful if and only if \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C}_{\Gamma})\) is simply connected.
If, furthermore, \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C}_{\Gamma})\) is contractible, then it will prove another long-standing open question about the Braid groups called the \(K(\pi,1)\)-conjecture.
** Summary
I hope that I have convinced you that the question
#+begin_question
How do we understand the global geometry of \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C})\)?
#+end_question
is important if you care about derived categories, and even if you do not.
* Stability conditions and metrics                                 :lecture2:
In the last lecture, we discussed the importance of the following question
#+begin_question
What is the global geometry of \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C})\)?
#+end_question

The main point of this lecture is to describe "how"?
We will see an approach to understanding the global geometry of \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C})\).
At the heart of the approach is to do what a geometric group theorist would do.
#+begin_quote
Study \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C})\) like a geometric group theorist studing the space of metrics on a manifold.
#+end_quote

To motivate this approach, I will first describe how a stability condition can be thought of as a metric.
We will then recall extremely fruitful constructions from the study of hyperbolic metrics on a surface, namely Teichmuller theory.
Finally, we will formulate categorical analogues of such constructions.
** What is a stability condition
Let \(\mathcal{C}\) be a triangulated category.
A stability condition on \(\mathcal{C}\) consists of two pieces of data:
1. A central charge, namely a homomorphism
   \[ Z \colon K(\mathcal{C}) \to \mathbf{C}\]
2. A slicing, namely a collection of abelian subcategories \(P(\phi)\) for every real number \(\alpha \in \mathcal{C}\).

The slicing satisfies the following properties:
1. \(P(\phi+1) = P(\phi)[1]\)
2. \(\Hom(P(\phi), P(\psi)) = 0\) if \(\phi > \psi\)
3. Harder Narasimhan property:
   For every \(x \in \mathcal{C}\), there exists a filtration
   \[ 0 = x_0 \to x_1 \to \cdots \to x_n = x \]
   whose sub-quotients \(a_{i}\) lie in \(P(\phi_i)\) with
   \[ \phi_0 > \phi_1 > \cdots > \phi_{n}.\]

The slicing and the central charge are compatible in the following sense.
For every \(0 \neq x \in P(\phi)\), we have
\[ Z(x) = m_{x} \cdot e^{i\pi\phi}\]
for some \(m_{x} \in \mathbf{R}_{> 0}.\)

Plus, there is a local finiteness condition that I will not explain.

For \(\mathcal{C}\) arising in algebraic geometry, such as \(\mathcal{C} = D^b(\operatorname{Coh} X)\), we often require that the central charge is numerical.
That is, the map
\[ Z \colon K(\mathcal{C}) \to \mathbf{C}\]
factors through the Chern character
\[ K(\mathcal{C}) \to H^{*}(X, \mathcal{Z}).\]
In effect, we replace \(K(\mathcal{C})\) by its image in cohomology called \(K^{\rm num}(\mathcal{C}).\)

The set of stability conditions on \(\mathcal{C}\) has a metric and hence a topology.

*Theorem* (Bridgeland 2007) --- The map
\[ \operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C}) \to \Hom(K(\mathcal{C}), \mathbf{C})\]
defined by
\[ (Z, P) \mapsto Z\]
is a local homeomorphism.

Here, local means "local on the source".
*** Example
Let \(X\) be a curve, for example \(X = \mathbf{P}^1\).
Take \(\mathcal{C} = D^b \operatorname{Coh}X\).
Let
\[ Z \colon K(\mathcal{C}) \to \mathbf{C}\]
be
\[ Z(E) = -\operatorname{deg} E + i \operatorname{rk} E.\]
For \(0 \leq \phi < 1\), set
\[P(\phi) = {\text{Semi-stable sheaves of phase \(\phi\)}}.\]
Then \((Z,P)\) defines a stability condition on \(\mathcal{C}\).

Check the HN condition.
** Metrics on triangulated categories
Let us begin by interpreting a stability condition as a metric.
Now, for certain triangulated categories, like the Fukaya category of curves on a surface etc, several authors have proved an isomorphism between the stability manifold and the space of appropriate metrics on the surface (Dmitrov, Haiden, Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Bridgeland, Smith).
This is excellent motivation to say that considering a stability condition as a metric is a good idea.
The interpretation that I am about to give is for any triangulated category and is more direct.

We first recall the notion of a metric on a category.
The following definition appears in [Lawvere].
I learned it from [Neeman].

#+begin_definition
A /metric/ on a category \(\mathcal{C}\) is a function \(\ell\) from the collection of morphisms of \(\mathcal{C}\) to \(\mathbf{R}_{\geq 0}\) such that
1. if \(f\) is an isomorphism, then \(\ell(f) = 0,\)
2. if \(a \xrightarrow{f} b \xrightarrow{g} c \) are composable morphisms, then
   \[ \ell(gf) \leq \ell(f) + \ell(g).\]
#+end_definition

You should think of a sequence of composable maps as a path in the category
\[ x_0 \to x_1 \to \cdots \to x_{n}.\]
The composition \(x_0 \to x_{n}\) is a "direct path".
The length of the direct path is no longer than the length of the broken path.

Now let \(\mathbf{C}\) be triangulated.
In this case, it is useful to consider a special class of metrics.
#+begin_definition
We say that a metric \(f\) on \(\mathcal{C}\) is /translation invariant/ of the length of \(f \colon a \to b\) only depends on the isomorphism class of the cone \(\operatorname{Cone}(f)\).
#+end_definition

In other words, in the diagram
#+begin_equation
\begin{tikzcd}
a \ar{r}{f}\ar{d} &  b \ar{d}\\
0 & \operatorname{Cone}(f)
\end{tikzcd}
#+end_equation
the top and the bottom arrows have the same length.
Thus, a translation invariant metric on \(\mathcal{C}\) is determined by the function
\[ m(a) = \ell(0 \to a).\]
Conversely, given \(m \colon \operatorname{Ob}(\mathcal{C}) \to \mathbf{R}_{\geq 0}\), we can define \(f \colon \operatorname{Mor}(\mathcal{C}) \to \mathbf{R}_{\geq 0}\) by setting
\[ \ell(a \to b) = m(\operatorname{Cone}(a \to b)).\]
Then \(\ell\) is, by construction, translation invariant.
But when is \(\ell\) a metric?
First of all, we must have \(m(0) = 0\), so that \(\ell\) vanishes on isomorphisms.
Secondly, let us investigate when \(\ell\) satisfies the triangle inequality.
Consider a sequence of morphisms
\[ a \xrightarrow{f} b \xrightarrow{g} c.\]
By the octahedral axiom, we have a distinguished triangle
\[ \operatorname{Cone}(f) \to \operatorname{Cone}(g \circ f) \to \operatorname{Cone}(g) \xrightarrow{+1}. \]
The condition
\[ \ell(g \circ f) \leq \ell(f) + \ell(g)\]
translates into
\[ m(\operatorname{Cone}(g \circ f)) \leq m(\operatorname{Cone}(f)) + m(\operatorname{Cone}(g)).\]
Thus, \(\ell\) will satisfy the triangle inequality for composable morphisms if \(m\) satisfies the triangle inequality for distinguished triangles.

As a result, we see that translation invariant metrics on \(\mathcal{C}\) are the same thing as functions \(m \colon \operatorname{Ob}(\mathcal{C}) \to \mathbf{R}_{\geq 0}\) such that in any distinguished triangle
\[ a \to b \to c \xrightarrow{+1}, \]
we have
\[ m(b) \leq m(a) + m(c).\]
** Metrics from a stability condition
Let \(\mathbf{\tau}\) be a stability condition on \(\mathcal{C}\).
Let me show you how \(\tau\) gives rise to a family of translation invariant metrics on \(\mathcal{C}\).

Define the function \(m_{\tau} \colon \operatorname{Ob}(\mathcal{C}) \to \mathbf{R}_{\geq 0}\), called the /mass function/, as follows.
If \(x \in \mathcal{C}\) is \(\tau\) semi-stable, set
\[ m_{\tau}(x) = |Z_{\tau}(x)|.\]
In general, let
\[ 0 = x_0 \to x_1 \to \dots \to x_n = x \]
be the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of \(x\) with sub-quotients \(a_{1}, \dots, a_{n}\).
Set
\[ m_\tau(x) = \sum |Z_\tau(a_i)|.\]

*Proposition*  -- The mass function \(m_{\tau}\) satisfies the triangle inequality.   That is, if
\[ x \to y \to z \xrightarrow{+1}\]
is a distinguished triangle, then
\[ m_\tau(y) \leq m_\tau(x) + m_\tau(z).\]

As a result, \(m_{\tau}\) defines a translation invariant metric on \(\mathcal{C}\).

In fact, \(m_{\tau}\) is one of a family of metrics we can define using \(\tau\).
Fix a positive real number \(q\).
We define the /\(q\)-mass function/ \(m_{\tau,q} \colon \operatorname{Ob}(\mathcal{C}) \to \mathbf{R}_{\geq 0}\) as follows.
If \(x \in \mathcal{C}\)  is semi-stable of phase \(\phi\), set
\[ m_{\tau,q}(x) = |Z_\tau(x)| q^\phi.\]
In general, let
\[ 0 = x_0 \to x_1 \to \dots \to x_n = x \]
be the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of \(x\) with sub-quotients \(a_{1}, \dots, a_{n}\) of phases \(\phi_{1}, \dots, \phi_{n}\).
Set
\[ m_{\tau,q}(x) = \sum |Z_{\tau}(a_{i})| q^{\phi_{i}}.\]

*Theorem* (Ikeda) --  For any \(q > 0\), the mass function \(m_{\tau,q}\) satisfies the triangle inequality.

As a result, the function \(m_{\tau,q}\) define a family of translation invariant metrics on \(\mathcal{C}\).
We will mostly be interested in the case \(q = 1\), but it is important to remember the added flexibility provided by varying the \(q\).
** To what extent can we recover \(\tau\) from \(m_{\tau,q}\)?
Consider a sequence of maps
\[ 0 = x_{0} \to x_{1} \to \dots \to x_{n} = x.\]
Recall that we view this is a path from \(0\) to \(x\).
If this sequence of maps is the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of \(x\), then, by construction, this path is a /geodesic path/ for the metric given by \(m_{\tau,q}\).
That is, the length of the arrow \(0 \to x\) is the sum of lengths of the arrows \(x_{i} \to x_{i+1}\).
This property, however, does not characterise HN filtrations---there can be many other geodesic paths to \(x\). 
Nevertheless, we have the following.

*Proposition* (BDL) ---  Let \(x\) be \(\tau\)-stable.  For the metric \(m_{\tau, q}\), the path \(0 \to x\) is an indivisible geodesic path (cannot be broken non-trivially).  Also, this indivisibility property characterises the stable objects.

As a result, if \(m_{\tau, q} = m_{\tau',q}\), then \(\tau\) and \(\tau'\) have the same stable objects.
But we cannot necessarily say that \(\tau = \tau'\).
There are examples where \(m_{\tau,q} = m_{\tau',q}\) for distinct \(\tau\) and \(\tau'\).
But here, the flexibility of being able to vary \(q\) comes handy.

*Theorem* (BDL) --- If \(m_{\tau,q} = m_{\tau',q}\) for two (or more) distinct values of \(q\), then \(\tau = \tau'\).

So, although /one/ metric may not recover the stability condition, the family definitely does.

*Aside* --- Which (translation invariant) metrics come from stability conditions?  This is a great question!

In particular situations, stronger results hold.  For example, let \(\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{C}_{\Gamma}\) be the 2-CY category associated to a graph \(\Gamma\).
Then \(\mathcal{C}\) has a so-called "standard \(t\)-structure", and \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C})\) has a distinguished connected component containing stability conditions that induce the standard \(t\)-structure.

*Theorem* (BDL) --- Let \(\tau, \tau'\) be stability conditions in the distinguished component of \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C}_{\Gamma})\).  Then \(m_{\tau} = m_{\tau'}\) implies that \(\tau'\) is a shift of \(\tau\).
* The Thurston compactification                                    :lecture3:
In what follows, I will work with the single metric given by \(m_{\tau}\) (that is, \(q = 1\)) for simplicity.
But everything has a \(q\)-analogue.
** Motivation from Teichmuller theory
Treating a stability condition as a metric allows us to construct a compactification of the space of stability conditions by emulating a construction in geometric group theory due to Thurston.
This construction compactifies the Teichmuller space of a surface.
It has been hugely benefitial in studying the mapping class group, and we can hope to reap similar benefits for auto-equivalence groups of categories.

Let me quickly recall Thurston's construction.
Fix a closed orientable surface \(M\) of genus \(g \geq 2\).
The Teichmuller space \(T(M)\) is the space of hyperbolic metrics of constant curvature \(-1\) on \(M\).
This is a finite dimensional non-compact manifold (turns out to be homeomorphic to \(\mathbf{R}^{6g-6}\)).
oThurston compactifies \(T(M)\) by first mapping it to an infinite projective space.
Let \(S\) be the collection of isotopy classes of simple closed curves on \(M\).
Consider the infinite projective space
\[ \P^S = (\mathbf{R}^{S} - 0) / \text{Scaling}.\]
We have a map
\[ i \colon T(M) \to \P^S\]
defined as follows.
Let \(s \in S\) be a curve, up to isotopy.
Let \(\ell_\mu(s)\) be the length of \(s\) with respect to \(\mu\) (that is, the minimum length of a representative of the isotopy class).
Set
\[ i(\mu) = [\ell_\mu].\]

*Theorem* (Thurston) ---
1. The map \(i\) is injective.  In fact, it is a homeomorphism onto its image.
2. The closure of the image of \(i\) is compact.
3. The closure is isomorphic to a closed ball.
   Its boundary sphere has a modular interpretation as the space of projective measured foliations.
** Towards a Thurston compactification of PStab
Using the metrics \(m_{\tau,q}\), we can emulate the same construction as before.

Recall that we have an action of \(\mathbf{C}\) on \(\operatorname{Stab}(\mathcal{C})\).
The number \(z = a+ib\) acts by scaling the central charge by \(e^{a+ib}\) and shifting the slicing by \(b\).
Set
\[ \operatorname{PStab} = \operatorname{Stab} / \mathbf{C}.\]
The action is properly discontinuous, so the quotient is also a manifold.

Let \(S \subset \mathcal{C}\) be the set of isomorphism classes of objects of \(\mathcal{C}\).
We have a map
\[ i \colon \operatorname{PStab}(\mathcal{C}) \to \P^{S}\]
defined by
\[ i \colon \tau \mapsto [m_{\tau}].\]
More generally, we can fix \(q_{1}, \dots, q_{n}\) and consider
\[ i \colon \operatorname{PStab}(\mathcal{C}) \to \P^{S} \times \dots \times \P^{S},\]
defined by
\[ i \colon \tau \mapsto ([m_{\tau,q_1}], \dots, [m_{\tau,q_n}]).\]

*Theorem* (BDL)  ---
1. Suppose \(S\) contains a (classical) generator of \(\mathcal{C}\).  Then the image of \(i\) is compact.
2. For \(n \geq 2\), the map \(i\) is injective.
   For the quiver categories \(\mathcal{C}_{\Gamma}\), the map \(i\) is injective for \(n = 1\).

The remaining task is to understand the geometry of the closure, for example, its boundary.
For this, it is nice to be able to take a smaller \(S\), one whose masses we understand.
Fortunately, there is considerable flexibilility in choosing \(S\).
The theorem remains true if we restrict \(S\) to contain:
- objects with no negative endomorphisms,
- objects in the heart of some bounded t-structure,
- objects that are stable with respect to some stability condition,
- for \(\mathcal{C}_{\Gamma}\), just the spherical objects.
* The Thurston compactification                                    :lecture3:
Recall that last time, we proposed a categorical analogue of Thurston's construction of a compactification of the Teichmuller space.
** Other approaches to compactifications
- Barbara Bolognese: (partial) completion of Stab using the metric inherited from the central charge.
- Broomhead, Pauksztello, Ploog, Woolf: Partial compactification of stability manifolds by massless semistable objects
** Other discussion of stab as metrics
- Haiden, Katzarkov, Kontsevich "Flat surfaces and stability structures"
- Bridgeland, Smith "Quadratic differentials"
** The Thurston boundary
We now explore which mass functions appear on the boundary of PStab.
We first recall the picture from geometry.
For simplicity, we consider the map \(m_{q}\) for \(q = 1\) and assume that the set \(S\) consists of indecomposable objects that have no endomorphisms of negative degree.

In Teichmuller theory, the following points appear on the boundary.
Let \(a\) be a simple closed curve (up to isotopy).
Define a functional on the set of simple closed curves by
\[ b \mapsto |a \cap b|.\]
This is an unsigned count of intersections.
(We have to make sure that we choose isotopy representatives for \(a\) and \(b\) are such that the intersection number is the minimum.)

There is a compelling categorical analogue of the intersection function above.
Henceforth, we will assume that all objects of our set \(S\) have the property that \(x\) is indecomposable and \(\operatorname{hom}^{i}(x,x) = 0\) for \(i < 0\).
Given a spherical object \(a\), define the functional \(\overline \operatorname{hom}_a\) as follows.
\begin{equation}
\overline \operatorname{hom}_a (x) =
\begin{cases}
\sum \dim \operatorname{hom}^{i}(a,x) & \text{if \(x \neq a[n]\) for any \(n\)}\\
0 & \text{if \(x \cong a[n]\) for some \(n\)}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

*Theorem* (BDL) --- Let \(\mathcal{C}\) be a (hom-finite, k-linear) triangulated category and \(a \in \mathcal{C}\) a spherical object that is semi-stable in a stability condition.
Then \(\mathrm{homBar}(a)\) lies on the boundary of \(\operatorname{PStab}(\mathcal{C})\).
More precisely, if \(a\) is semi-stable for \(\tau\), then
\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \sigma_{a}^{n} \tau = [\mathrm{homBar}(a)].\]
*** A sketch of the proof
- Recall the proof from geometry: dehn twist in \(a\) increases the length of a curve \(c\) by roughly \((c \cap a) \cdot \ell(a)\):

- Sketch the proof.

In homological algebra, the proof follows the same idea.
We have the triangle
\[ \operatorname{Hom}(a,x) \otimes a \to x \to \sigma_{a}x.\]
By repeatedly taking twists, we get
\[ x \to \sigma_a^x \to \cdots \to \sigma^{n}(x)\]
whose subquotients are twists of \(\operatorname{Hom}(a,x) \otimes a\).
So, we have
\[ m(\sigma^{n}(x)) \leq m(x) + n \operatorname{hom}(a,x) m(a).\]
The key point is that when we divide by \(n\) and take \(n \to \infty\), the inequality approaches an equality.
So the limit of the LHS (divided by \(n\)) is the hom-functional.

This is true except when \(x\) is a twist of \(a\)! 
In that case, the filtration above is nowhere close to the HN filtration!
In fact, \(x\) just remains a shift of \(a\) after twisting, and after dividing by \(n\), the mass goes to 0.
** The A2 case
- The A_n category.
- The standard heart.
- The braid group action.
- All spherical objects are in one braid orbit.
- All stability conditions are in the braid orbit of a standard stability condition.
- Draw the final picture for the A2 compactification.

- Raise the question -- what are the irrational points on the boundary?
*** What is involved in obtaining this picture?
- The key issue is to understand HN filtrations.
- Thanks to the braid group, it suffices to understand how the HN filtration evolves when we apply a braid.
- The situation is not linear!
- But the situation is piecewise linear.  Explain the automaton.

\(\gamma = \sigma_2\sigma_1 = \sigma_{X}\sigma_2 = \sigma_1\sigma_{X}\).
** Summary of the talks
- Important to understand the global geometry of Stab.
- Constructing a compactification goes a long way towards understading the global geometry.
- Good idea to view stability conditions as metrics, and understand their limits as limiting metrics.
