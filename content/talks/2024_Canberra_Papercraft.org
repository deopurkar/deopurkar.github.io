Title: Papercraft

Abstract: My origami directions call for a square, but I have an
A4-sized rectangle.  But I also have scissors!  Can I cut the
rectangle and reglue the pieces to get a square?  More generally, when
can I cut a shape A and reglue it to make another shape B?  Come to
the talk and find the answer.  Scissors, tape, and paper optional, but
recommended!
