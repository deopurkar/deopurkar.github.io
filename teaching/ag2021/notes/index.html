The objects of study in algebraic geometry are called algebraic varieties.
The building blocks for general algebraic varieties are certain subsets of the affine space.
Let us first recall affine space.
</p>

<p>
Let \(k\) be a field and let \(n\) be a non-negative integer.
The <i>affine \(n\)-space over \(k\)</i>, denoted by \(\mathbb A^n_k\) is the set of \(n\)-tuples \(a_1,\dots, a_n\) whose entries \(a_i\) lie in \(k\). 
Thus, \(\mathbb A^n_k\) is nothing but the product \(k^n\).
The product \(k^n\) has quite a bit of extra structure&#x2014;it is a \(k\)-vector space, for example&#x2014;but we wish to forget it.
That is the reason for choosing different notation.
In particular, the zero tuple does not play a distinguished role.

Let \(k[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) denote the ring of polynomials in variables \(x_1, \dots, x_n\) and coefficients in \(k\).
An <i>affine algebraic subset</i> of the affine space \(\mathbb A^n_k\) is the common zero locus of a set of polynomials.
More precisely, a set \(S \subset \mathbb A^n_k\) is an affine algebraic subset if there exists a set of polysomials \(A \subset k[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) such that
\[ S = \{a \in \mathbb A^n_k \mid f(a) = 0 \text{ for all } f \in A\}.\]

Let \(R\) be a ring.
Recall that a subset \(I \subset R\) is an <i>ideal</i> if it is closed under addition and multiplication by elements of \(R\).
Given any subset \(A \subset R\) the <i>ideal generated by \(A\)</i>, denoted by \(\langle A \rangle\) is the smallest ideal containing \(A\).
This ideal consists of all elements \(r\) of  \(R\) that can be written as a linear combination
\[ r = a_1 r_1 + \cdots + a_m r_m,\]

In our definition of \(V(A)\), the subset \(A\) may be infinite. 
But it turns out that we can replace it by a finite one without changing \(V(A)\).
This is a consequence of the Hilbert basis theorem, which, in turn, has to do with a fundamental property of rings.

<p>
Assume \(R\) is Noetherian, and let \(I \subset R[x]\) be an ideal.
We must show that \(I\) is finitely generated.
The basic idea is to use the division algorithm, while keeping track of the ideals formed by the leading coefficients.
</p>

<p>
For every non-negative integer \(m\), define

\begin{align*}
J_m &= \{{\rm Leading\ coeff} (f) \mid f \in I, f \neq 0, \quad \deg(f) \leq m\} \cup \{0\}

Since \(R\) is Noetherian, the chain \(J_1 \subset J_2 \subset \cdots\) stabilises; say \(J_m = J_{m+1} = \cdots\).
Let \(S_i\) be a finite set of generators for \(J_i\), and for \(a \in S_i\), let \(p_a \in I\) be a non-zero element of degree at most \(i\) whose leading coefficient is \(a\).
We claim that the (finite) set \(\{p_a \mid a \in S_1 \cup \cdots \cup S_m\}\) generates \(I\).    
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org9dc0260">
<p>
Let \(G = \{p_a \mid a \in S_1 \cup \cdots \cup S_m\}\). By construction, this is a subset of \(I\), so the ideal it generates is contained in \(I\).
We remains to prove that every \(f \in I\) is a linear combination of elements of \(G\).
It will be convenient to set \(S_n = S_m\) for all \(n \geq m\).
</p>

<p>
We induct on the degree of \(f\) (leaving the base case to you).
Suppose the degree of \(f\) is \(n\) and the statement is true for elements of degree less than \(n\).
By construction, the leading coefficient of \(f\) is an \(R\)-linear combination of elements of \(S_n\), say
\[ {\rm LC}(f) = \sum c_i s_i.\]
Let \(n_i\) be the degree of \(p_{s_i}\); then by construction \(n_i \leq n\).
Consider the linear combination \(g = \sum c_i p_{s_i} x^{n-n_i}\).
See that \(g\) lies in \(I\), has degree \(n\), the same leading coefficient as \(f\), and is an \(R[x]\)-linear combination of elements of \(G\).
So \(f-g \in I\) has lower degree.
By inductive hypothesis, \(f-g\) is an \(R[x]\)-linear combination of elements of \(G\), and hence so is \(f\).

The notion of affine algebraic sets allows us to define a topology on \(\mathbb A^n_k\).
Recall that we can specify a topology on a set by specifying what the open subsets are, or equivalently, what the closed subsets are.
In our case, it is more convenient to do the latter.
The collection of closed subsets must satisfy the following properties.

Without loss of generality, suppose \(p(\mathbf{a}) = 0 \text{ for all } p \in A\). Then for all polynomials \(pq\) with \(p \in A, q \in B\), \(pq(\mathbf{a}) = 0\). So \(\mathbf{a} \in V(\{pq : p \in A, q \in B\})\) and therefore \(V(A)\cup V(B) \subseteq V(\{pq : p \in A, q \in B\})\). Now suppose \(\mathbf{a} \notin V(A)\cup V(B)\). Then there exists some \(p \in A, q \in B\) such that \(pq(\mathbf{a}) \ne 0\).

So \(V(A) \cup V(B) = V(\{pq : p \in A, q \in B\})\) and therefore \(V(A) \cup V(B)\) is closed. Following this process with an inductive argument, finite unions of closed sets are closed.

Let \(I\) be an ideal, and set \(\sqrt I = \{f \mid f^n \in I \text{ for some } n > 0\}.\)
Then \(\sqrt I\) is a radical ideal.
</p>

<div class="skipped" id="org1728b0a">
<div class="proof" id="org9cde7ee">
<p>
(Assume a commutative ring)
We will first show that \(\sqrt I \subset R\) is an ideal.
Let \(f \in \sqrt I, r \in R\), and by definition of \(\sqrt I\), we suppose \(f^n \in I\) for some \(n > 0\)
\[ (rf)^n = r^nf^n.\]
Since \(r^n \in R, f^n \in I\), by definition of ideal, we have \(r^nf^n \in I\).
Therefore, \((rf)^n \in I\) for some \(n > 0\), and by definition, we have \(rf \in \sqrt I\).
Therefore, \(\sqrt I\) is closed under multiplication by elements of \(R\).
</p>

<p>
Let \(f, g \in \sqrt I\), with \(f^n \in I\), \(g^m \in I\).
</p>
\begin{align*}
(f+g)^{m+n} &= c_0 f^{m+n} + c_1 f^{m+n-1}g^1 + \dots + c_m f^ng^m + \cdots + c_{m+n} g^{m+n} \\
&= c_0 f^m \times f^n + c_1 f^{m-1}g \times f^n + \dots + c_m f^n g^m \\
& \qquad + c_{m+1} f^{n-1}g^1 \times g^m + \dots + c_{m+n} g^n \times g^m.
\end{align*}
<p>
(\(c_i\) are the corresponding binomial coefficients in \(I\)).
As shown above, \((f+g)^{m+n}\) can be written as an \(R\)-linear combination of \(f^n\) and \(g^m\).
Since \(f^n \in I, g^m \in I\), by definition of ideal, we have \((f+g)^{m+n} \in I\).
Therefore, by definition we have \((f+g) \in \sqrt I\) and \(\sqrt I\) is closed under addition.
Therefore, \(\sqrt I\) is an ideal.
</p>

<p>
Now we need to show that \(\sqrt I\) is a radical ideal.
Suppose \(f \in R\) with \(f^n \in \sqrt I\) for some \(n > 0\).
Then, by definition of \(\sqrt I\), we have \((f^n)^m \in I\) for some \(m > 0\).
\[ (f^n)^m = f^{nm} \in I, nm > 0.\]
Therefore, by definition, we have \(f \in \sqrt I\).

\(\boxed{\supset}\)
   Note that \(I \subset \sqrt{I}\) and hence \(V(\sqrt{I}) \subset V(I)\). More specifically, for any \(f \in I\) we have that \(f^1 \in I\) and so \(f \in \sqrt{I}\). Now suppose \(a \in V(\sqrt{I})\). Then \(f(a) = 0\) for all \(f \in \sqrt{I}\). But since \(I \subset \sqrt{I}\), this implies the weaker statement that for all \(f \in I\), we have \(f(a) = 0\). This is the same as saying that \(a \in V(I)\).
</p>

<p>
\(\boxed{\subset}\) Now let \(a \in V(I)\). Then let \(f \in \sqrt{I}\). By definition of \(\sqrt{I}\) there exists some \(n>0\) such that \(f^n \in I\) and hence \(f^n(a) = 0\) by assumption. We want to show that this implies \(f(a) = 0\) which gives us that \(a \in V(\sqrt{I})\), completing the proof. This is because \(f\) is an arbitrary element of \(\sqrt{I}\). We are done if \(n=1\). 
</p>

<p>
Otherwise we use that we are working in a field which has no zero divisors. More specifically, \(f^n(a) = f(a)f^{n-1}(a) = 0\) implies that either \(f(a) = 0\) or \(f^{n-1}(a) = 0\). If \(f(a) = 0\) we are done. Otherwise if \(f^{n-1}(a) = 0\), we repeat the previous step for \(f^{n-1}(a) = f(a)f^{n-2}(a) = 0\) and so on, until we get \(f(a) = 0\) or until \(n=2\) in which case we have \(f^2(a) = f(a)f(a) = 0\) which implies \(f(a) = 0\) as well.

Let \(m \subset k[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) be a maximal ideal.
Taking \(K = k\) and \(L = k[x_1,\dots,x_n]/m\) in Theorem <a href="#orgc847605">1.7.1</a>, and using that \(k\) is algebraically closed, we get that the natural map \(k \to k[x_1,\dots,x_n]/m\) is an isomorphism.
Let \(a_i \in k\) be the pre-image of \(x_i\) under this isomorphism. 
Then we have \(m = (x_1-a_1,\dots,x_n-a_n)\).
</p>
<div class="skipped" id="org84fba22">
<div class="proof" id="orgc63e3ca">
<p>
Since \(m\) is a maximal ideal, \(L := k[x_1, ..., x_n] / m\) is a field. Let \(\pi : k[x_1, ..., x_n] \to L\) be the projection map. Consider the inclusion map \(\mathfrak{i} : k \to k[x_1, ..., x_n]\). We embed \(k\) in \(L\) via the map \(\phi := \pi \circ \mathfrak{i}\). We now show that \(\phi\) is an ismomorphism.
</p>

<p>
\paragraph{Surjectivity of $\phi$}.
The existence of this map tells us that \(L\) is a \(k\) algebra. Moreover, \(L\) is a finitely generated \(k\) algebra, since \(L\) is generated by \(\{ \pi(x_1), ..., \pi(x_n)\}\). Now Theorem 1.7.1 applies, and we deduce that \(L\) is a finite extension of \(k\). In particular, \(L\) must be an algebraic extension of \(k\). If \(L\) were not an algebraic extension of \(k\), then there would exist an element \(l \in L\) transcendental over \(k\); but then \(L\) could not be a finite extension of \(K\), because the set \(\{ l^{j} \}_{j = 0, 1, 2, ...}\) would be linearly independent. We conclude that \(L\) is an algebraic extension of \(k\).
</p>

<p>
We know that given any \(l \in L\), there is a polynomial \(p(y) \in k[y]\), where \(y\) is any new variable, such that \(p(l) = 0\). Let \(p(y)\) be the monic polynomial of least degree satisfying the above. Then \(p(y)\) is irreducible, since otherwise it would have a factor of smaller degree also satisfying the above, contradicting the minimality of the degree of \(p(y)\). Since \(k\) is algebraically closed, the irreducible monic polynomials are all of the form \(x - a\), for \(a \in k\). As such, we have \(p(y) = y - a\) for some \(a \in k\). It follows that \(l \in k\), since we must have \(l = a\). To be precise, what we have really shown is that \(l \in \phi(k)\), since \(k\) is not itself a subset of \(L\), but can be identified with a subset of \(L\). We conclude that \(L = \phi(k)\). This tells us that \(\phi\) is surjective.

Because \(\phi\) is a field homomorphism, \(\phi\) must be injective. Indeed, the kernel of \(\phi\) is an ideal of \(k\). As such, the kernel of \(\phi\) is either the zero ideal or the unit ideal. Since \(\phi\) is not identically zero, the kernel must be the zero ideal. This completes the proof that \(\phi\) is an isomorphism.
</p>

<p>
\paragraph{Completion of Proof}
Because \(\phi : k \to L\) is an isomorphism, we can define \(a_i := \phi^{-1}(\pi(x_i))\), for each \(i = 1, ..., n\). We claim that with this choice of \(a_1, .., a_n \in k\), the equation in \eqref{2} holds. If \(p \in (x_1 - a_1, ..., x_n - a_n)\), then there exist \(q_i \in k[x_1, ..., x_n]\) such that
</p>
\begin{equation} \label{2}
p = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} q_i (x_i - \mathfrak{i}(a_i)).
\end{equation}
<p>
We could remove the \(\mathfrak{i}\) in \eqref{2}; it just serves as a reminder that \(k[x_1, ..., x_n]\) contains a copy of \(k\), not \(k\) itself. From \eqref{2}, we obtain
</p>
\begin{equation} \label{3}
\pi(p) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \pi(q_i) (\pi(x_i) - \phi(a_i)) = 0.
\end{equation}
<p>
The first equality in \eqref{2} holds by the fact that \(\pi\) is a ring homomorphism, and the second equality holds because \(\phi(a_i) = \pi(x_i)\), for \(i = 1, ..., n\). From \eqref{3} we conclude that \(p \in m\), since the kernel of \(\pi\) is precisely the ideal \(m\). We have shown that
</p>
\begin{equation} \label{4}
(x_1 - a_1, ..., x_n - a_n) \subseteq m.
\end{equation}
<p>
Now suppose that \(p \in m\). Then \(\pi(p) = 0\). On the other hand, we can write
</p>
\begin{equation} \label{5}
p = \sum_{i = 0}^{d} \sum_{j_1 + ... + j_n = i} \mathfrak{i}(c_{j_1, ..., j_n}) x_{1}^{j_1} ... x_{n}^{j_n},
\end{equation}
<p>
where \(d\) is the degree of \(p\) and the \(c_{j_1, ..., j_n}\) are elements of \(k\). Equation \eqref{5} yields
</p>
\begin{equation}\label{6}
\begin{split}
\pi(p) &= \sum_{i = 0}^{d} \sum_{j_1 + ... + j_n = i} \phi(c_{j_1, ..., j_n}) \pi(x_{1})^{j_1} ... \pi(x_n)^{j_n} \\
&= \sum_{i = 0}^{d} \sum_{j_1 + ... + j_n = i} \phi(c_{j_1, ..., j_n}) \phi(a_1)^{j_1} ... \phi(a_n)^{j_n} \\
&= \phi\bigg{(} \sum_{i = 0}^{d} \sum_{j_1 + ... + j_n = i} c_{j_1, ..., j_n} a_{1}^{j_1} ... a_{n}^{j_n} \bigg{)}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
<p>
The second equality in \eqref{6} holds by the definition of \(a_1, ..., a_n\), and the third equality holds because \(\phi\) is a ring homomorphism. From \eqref{6} and the fact that \(\pi(p) = 0\), we have that \(\phi\) maps \(\sum_{i = 0}^{d} \sum_{j_1 + ... + j_n = i} c_{j_1, ..., j_n} a_{1}^{j_1} ... a_{n}^{j_n}\) to zero. Since \(\phi\) is an isomorphism, it follows that
</p>
\begin{equation} \label{7}
\sum_{i = 0}^{d} \sum_{j_1 + ... + j_n = i} c_{j_1, ..., j_n} a_{1}^{j_1} ... a_{n}^{j_n} = 0, \hspace{1em} \textrm{ in the field } k.
\end{equation}
<p>
From \eqref{7}, we have that the point \((a_1, ..., a_n)\) is a root of the polynomial \(p\). We can write
</p>
\begin{equation} \label{8}
p = \sum_{i = 0}^{d} \sum_{j_1 + ... + j_n = i} \mathfrak{i}(e_{j_1, ..., j_n}) (x_1 - a_1)^{j_1} ... (x_n - a_n)^{j_n},
\end{equation}
<p>
for suitably chosen \(e_{j_1, ..., j_n} \in k\). For example, we could define
</p>
\begin{equation} \label{9}
q(x_1, ..., x_n) = p(x_1 + a_1, ..., x_n + a_1).
\end{equation}
<p>
We think of the right-hand side of \eqref{9} as a polynomial in \(x_1, ..., x_n\). &ldquo;Evaluating&rdquo; \(q\) at \((x_1 - a_1, ..., x_n - a_n)\) gives back \(p\), by definition, while the right-hand side of \eqref{9} becomes a polynomial in the variables \(x_1 - a_1, ..., x_n - a_n\). This is one way to show that \(p\) can be written in the form \eqref{8}. Now, the term with \(i = 0\) in \eqref{8} is the constant term \(e_{0, ..., 0}\). Evaluating \(p\) at \((a_1, ..., a_n)\) in \eqref{8} shows that \(p(a_1, ..., a_n) = e_{{0, ..., 0}}\). By \eqref{7}, we have \(p(a_1, ..., a_n) = 0\), so the constant term \(e_{{0, ..., 0}}\) must also be zero. This means that every term in \eqref{8} belongs to \((x_1 - a_1, ..., x_n - a_n)\). It follows that \(p \in (x_1 - a_1, ..., x_n - a_n)\). We have shown that
</p>
\begin{equation} \label{10}
m \subseteq (x_1 - a_1, ..., x_n - a_n).
\end{equation}
<p>
From \eqref{4} and \eqref{10}, we conclude that \eqref{2} holds. This completes the proof.

Suppose \(I\) is not the unit ideal.

We show that \(V(I)\) is non-empty.

To do so, we use that every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal.

<p>
So, as \(I\) is proper, it is contained in some maximal ideal \(M\).

But
\[ I \subset M \implies V(M) \subset V(I) .\]

But by theorem 1.6.9,
\[ M = \langle x_1 - a_1, \ldots, x_n - a_n \rangle ,\]
where \(a_i \in l\) is the preimage of \(x_i\) under the isomoprhism of the natural map \(k \to k [x_1, \ldots, x_n] / M\), for each \(i\).

So \(V(M) = \{ (a_1, \ldots, a_n) \}\).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-7-4">
<p>
We consider the system \(g = 0\) for \(g \in I\) and \(f \neq 0\).
Notice that the last one is not an equation, but there is a trick that allows us to convert it into an equation.
Let \(y\) be a new variable, and consider the polynomial ring \(k[x_1,\dots,x_n,y]\).
In the bigger ring, consider the system of equations \(g = 0\) for \(g \in I\) and \(yf - 1 = 0\).
By our assumption, this system of equations has no solutions.
</p>
<div class="skipped" id="orged37e3a">
<p>
Why is this?
Solutions to the original and augmented system are in bijection; if \((a_1,...,a_n)\) satisfies \(g=0\) and \(f\neq 0\), then there exists a unique value of \(y\), \(\frac{1}{f(a_1,...,a_n)}\), such that the second system is solved. Similarly, a solution to the second system constitutes a solution to the first, by simply ignoring the value of y, because if \(yf-1=0\) then \(f\) must be non-zero.
Then, by assumption of Theorem 1.6.10, \(f\) is identically zero in \(V(I)\), so the original system has no solutions. Therefore the augmented system has no solutions, and by Theorem 1.6.8, the ideal generated by \(g\in I\) and \(yf-1\) is the unit ideal in \(k[x_1,...x_n,y]\).
So then we can write
\[
1 = \sum c_i(x_1,...,x_n,y) g_i(x1,...,x_n,y) + c(x_1,...x_n,y) (yf-1)
\]
We transform this expression in \(k[x_1,...x_n,y]\) to an expression in the fraction field \(k(x_1,...x_n)\) by setting \(y = \frac{1}{f(x_1,...,x_n)}\), and since for this choice of \(y\) we have that \(yf-1\) vanishes, we get
\[
1 = \sum c_i(x_1,...,x_n, \frac{1}{f(x_1,...,x_n)}) g_i(x1,...,x_n,y) \in k(x_1,...x_n)
\]
Now, since this is a polynomial in \(\frac{1}{f(x_1,...,x_n)}\), multiplying through by a sufficiently large power \(N\) of \(f\) gives
\[
f^N = \sum p_i(x_1,...,x_n) g_i(x1,...,x_n,y) \in k[x_1,...x_n]
\]
So we can conclude that \(f^N\) is in I.

We show that the maps \(I \to V(I)\) and \(S \to I(S)\) are mutual inverses.
That is, we show that \(I(V(I)) = I\) if \(I\) is a radical ideal, and \(V(I(S)) = S\) if \(S\) is a Zariski closed subset of \(\mathbb A^n_k\).
</p>

<p>
 Let us first show that for any ideal \(I\), we have \(I(V(I)) = \sqrt I\).
Suppose \(f \in \sqrt I\), then \(f^n \in I\) for some \(n > 0\).
But then \(f^n\) is identically zero on \(V(I)\), and hence so is \(f\); that is, \(f \in I(V(I))\).
It remains to show that \(I(V(I)) \subset \sqrt I\).
 Let \(f \in I(V(I))\).
 Then \(f\) is identically zero on \(V(I)\).
 By <a href="#org4bbd3ab">1.6.10</a>, there is some \(n\) such that \(f^n \in I\), and hence \(f \in \sqrt I\).
</p>

<p>
Let us now show that \(V(I(S)) = S\).
Since \(S\) is Zariski closed, we know that \(S = V(J)\) for some ideal \(J\).
So \(I(S) = I(V(J)) = \sqrt{J}.\)
But we know that \(V(J) = V(\sqrt{J})\), and hence \(V(I(S)) = S\).
The proof of Theorem <a href="#org506b26f">1.6.7</a> is then complete.

<a id="org0e9320a"></a>
Let \(X \subset \mathbb A^n\) be a Zariski closed subset.
Let \(f\) be a regular function on \(X\).
Then there exists a polynomial \(P \in k[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) such that \(P(x) = f(x)\) for all \(x \in X\).
</p>

<div class="proof" id="orgf808334">
<p>
By definition, we know that for every \(x \in X\), there is a Zariski open set \(U \subset X\) and polynomials \(p, q\) such that \(f = p/q\) on \(U\).
The set \(U\) and the polynomials \(p, q\) may depend on \(x\), so let us denote them by \(U_x\), \(p_x\), and  \(q_x\).
We need to combine all of these \(p\)&rsquo;s and \(q\)&rsquo;s and construct a single polynomial \(P\) that agrees with \(f\) for all \(x\).
</p>

<p>
This is done by a &ldquo;partition of unity&rdquo; argument.
First, let us do some preparation.
We know that \(p_x / q_x = f\) on \(U_x\), but we know nothing about \(p_x\) and \(q_x\) on the complement of \(U_x\).
Our first step is a small trick that lets us assume that both \(p_x\) and \(q_x\) are identically zero on the complement of \(U_x\).
</p>

<p>
Since \(U_x \subset X\) is open, its complement is closed.
By the definition of the Zariski topology, this means that
\[X \setminus U_x = X \cap V(A),\]
for some \(A \subset k[x_1,\dots, x_n]\).
Since \(x \in U_x\), at least one of the polynomials in \(A\) must be non-zero at \(x\).
Let \(g\) be such a polynomial, and set \(U'_x = X \cap \{g \neq 0\}\).
Then \(U'_x \subset U_x\) is a possibly smaller open set containing \(x\).
Set \(p'_x = p_x \cdot g\) and \(q'_x = q_x \cdot g\).
Then we have \(f = p'_x/q'_x\) on \(U'_x\), and we also have \(p'_x \equiv q'_x \equiv 0 \) on \(X \setminus U'_x\).
So, we may assume from the beginning that both \(p_x\) and \(q_x\) are identically zero on the complement of \(U_x\)..
</p>

<p>
Now comes the crux of the argument.
Suppose \(X = V(I)\).
Consider the set of &ldquo;denominators&rdquo; \(\{q_x \mid x \in X\}\).
Note that the system of equations
\[ g = 0 \text{ for all } g \in I \text{ and } q_x = 0 \text{ for all } x \in X\]
has no solution!
</p>
<div class="skipped" id="orgfd59246">
<p>
Why is this the case?
\(\{q_x=0 \text{ for all } x\in X\}\subseteq X^c\) because for any \(x\in X\), there exists a \(q_x\) such that \(q_x(x)\ne0\), by definition of the \(q_x\)&rsquo;s. Since \(\{g=0 \text{ for all } g\in I\}=V(I)=X\), the system of equations has no solutions.
</p>

</div>
<p>
By the Nullstellensatz, this means that the ideal \(I + \langle q_x \mid q \in X \rangle\) is the unit ideal.
That is, we can write
\[ 1 = g + r_1q_{x_1} + \dots + r_m q_{x_m}\]
for some polynomials \(r_1, \dots, r_m\).
Take \(P = r_1p_{x_1} + \dots + r_m p_{x_m}\).
Then \(f = P\) on all of \(X\).
</p>
<div class="skipped" id="orgf2f5844">
<p>
Why is this the case?
We have that \(X = U_{x_{1}} \cup \dots \cup U_{x_{m}}\), i.e. \(X\) is the union of finitely many \(U_{x_{i}}\)&rsquo;s. Let \(x \in X\) and assume \(x\) is in only some of these \(U_{x_{i}}\)&rsquo;s. Without loss of generality, assume \(x \in U_{x_{1}}, \dots, U_{x_{j}}\) and \(x \notin U_{x_{j + 1}}, \dots, U_{x_{m}}\). Then on \(U_{x_{1}} \cap \dots \cap U_{x_{j}}\), we have \(\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{p_{x_{1}}(x)}{q_{x_{1}}(x)} = \dots = \frac{p_{x_{j}}(x)}{q_{x_{j}}(x)}\). Also, \(1 = r_{1}(x)q_{x_{1}}(x) + \dots r_{j}(x)q_{x_{j}}(x)\) and \(P(x) = r_{1}(x)p_{x_{1}}(x) + \dots + r_{j}(x)p_{x_{j}}(x)\).
</p>

<p>
But for all \(i \in \{1, \dots, j\}\) and \(\lambda_{i} \in k[x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}]\) with at least one \(\lambda_{i} \neq 0\)
\[\displaystyle \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{j} \lambda_{i}(x) p_{x_{i}}(x)}{\sum_{i = 1}^{j} \lambda_{i}(x) q_{x_{i}}(x)} = \frac{p_{x_{i}}(x)}{q_{x_{i}}(x)} = f(x).\] More specifically, \(\displaystyle P(x) = \frac{P(x)}{1} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{j} r_{i}(x)p_{x_{i}}(x)}{\sum_{i = 1}^{j} r_{i}(x)q_{x_{i}}(x)} = f(x)\). Therefore, \(f = P\) on all of \(X\).

It is easy to check that \(f\) is a bijection, but not an isomorphism.
</p>
<div class="skipped" id="orgbc2146c">
<p>
Here is the argument.
</p>

<p>
Isomorphic varieties have isomorphic rings of functions. From 1.4.3 we know that \(f: X\rightarrow Y\) induces the map \(f^{*}: k[Y] \rightarrow k[X]\).
</p>

<p>
Claim: \(f^{*}\) is not surjective.
</p>
\begin{align*}
    f^{*}  &\colon \frac{k[x,y]}{(y^2 - x^3)}  \rightarrow k[t]\\
    x &\mapsto t^2\\
    y &\mapsto t^3
\end{align*}    
<p>
\(t\) is not in the image of \(f_*\).
Monomials in Im(\(f_*\)) have degrees that are 2\(\alpha\) + 3\(\beta\) where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are non-zero integers.  We can only add and subtract monomial terms with equal powers. Thus we only need to consider whether we can get a monomial in \(t\) by multiplying \(t^2\) and \(t^3\) by other polynomials in \(t^2\) and \(t^3\). We cannot. Thus it is shown that \(f_*\) is not a surjective map.
</p>

<p>
This implies \(f\) is not an isomorphism, if it were, \(f\) would have an inverse, \(f^{-1}\). \(f^{-1}\) would then induce the inverse of \(f^{*}\). 
Which as we have seen, does not exist.

Let \(U_f \subset \mathbb A^n\) be the complement of \(V(f)\).
Then \(U_f\) is isomorphic to an affine variety, namely the variety \(V(yf-1) \subset \mathbb A^{n+1}\), where \(y\) denotes the \((n+1)\)-th coordinate.
</p>
<div class="skipped" id="org4a110f7">
<div class="proof" id="org6af1011">
<p>
We have that \(U_f=V(f)^c=\{(x_1,\dots,x_n)|f(x_1,\dots,x_n)\neq 0\}\). 
</p>

<p>
Also, \(V(yf-1)=\{(x_1,\dots,x_n,y)|y\cdot f(x_1,\dots,x_n)-1=0\}\). 
</p>

<p>
So we can define a map \(\phi:V(yf-1)\to U_f\), where
\[\phi(x_1,\dots,x_n,y)=(x_1,\dots,x_n)\]
This is clearly a regular map.
</p>

<p>
We can define another map \(\psi:U_f\to V(yf-1)\), where
\[\psi(x_1,\dots,x_n)=\left(x_1,\dots,x_n,\frac{1}{f(x_1,\dots,x_n)}\right)\]
This is well-defined, since \(f(x_1,\dots,x_n)\neq 0\), and this is also a regular map.
</p>

<p>
Then 
</p>
\begin{align*}
    \psi\circ\phi(x_1,\dots,x_n,y) & =  \psi(x_1,\dots,x_n) \\
    & = \left(x_1,\dots,x_n,\frac{1}{f(x_1,\dots,x_n)}\right)

<p>
But \(y\) must satisfy \(yf(x_1,\dots,x_n)-1\), so \(y=\frac{1}{f(x_1,\dots,x_n)}\), and thus \(\psi\circ\phi=id_{V(yf-1)}\). 
</p>

Also,

\begin{align*}
    \phi\circ\psi(x_1,\dots,x_n) & = \phi\left(x_1,\dots,x_n,\frac{1}{f(x_1,\dots,x_n)}\right) \\
    & = (x_1,\dots,x_n)

The varieties we have seen so far have been sub-sets of the affine space.
Using these as buildig blocks, we can construct general algebraic varieties.
The definition is analogous to the definition of a manifold in differential geometry, using open subsets of \(\mathbb R^n\) as building blocks.
</p>

<p>
Let \(X\) be a topological space.
A <i>quasi-affine chart</i> on \(X\) consists of an open subset \(U \subset X\), a quasi-affine variety \(V\) and a homeomorphism \(\phi_{UV} \colon U \to V\).
Via this isomorphism, we can &ldquo;transport&rdquo; the algebraic structure (for example, the notion of a regular function) from \(V\) to \(U\).
</p>

<p>
Let \(\phi_1 \colon U_1 \to V_1\) and \(\phi_2 \colon U_2 \to V_2\) be two quasi-affine charts on \(X\) (see Figure <a href="#org66fa8ff">1</a>).
Set \(U_{12} = U_1 \cap U_2\).
Consider the open subsets \(V_{12} = \phi_1 (U_{12}) \subset V_1\) and \(V_{21} = \phi_2(U_{12}) \subset V_2\).
Being open subsets of quasi-affine varieties, they are themselves quasi-affine varieties.
Furthermore, the map
\[\phi_2 \circ \phi_1^{-1} \colon V_{12} \to V_{21}\]
is a homeomorphism.
We say that the two charts are <i>compatible</i> if this map is a (bi-regular) isomorphism.

<p>
When we have two charts, one on \(U_1\) and another on \(U_2\), then the intersection \(U_1 \cap U_2\) gets two different charts.
Compatibility ensures that these two charts are related by a bi-regular isomorphism, so that the algebraic structure coming from one is the same as the one coming from the other.

A <i>quasi-affine atlas</i> on \(X\) is a collection of compatible charts \(\phi_i \colon U_i \to V_i\) such that the \(U_i\) cover \(X\).

<h4 id="orgf2f2989"><span class="section-number-4">3.2.2.</span> Intuition</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-2-2">
<p>
Before describing how \(\mathbb P^n_k\) is an algebraic variety, let us build some intuition about projective space.
For easy visualisations, it helps to take \(k = \mathbb R\) or \(k = \mathbb C\).
A one dimensional subspace of \(k^{n+1}\) is also called a <i>line</i>. 
Note that, by this definition, a line must contain the origin.
</p>

<p>
Let us take \(n = 0\).
Then there is a unique one-dimenional subspace of \(k^{n+1} = k\), so \(\mathbb P^0_k\) is just a single point.
</p>

<p>
Let us take \(n = 1\).
Then \(\mathbb P^1_k\) is the set of lines (through the origin) in \(k^2\).
Let us take \(k = \mathbb R\).
Every line through the origin is uniquely determined by its slope, which can be any element of \(\mathbb R\), so it seems like \(\mathbb P^1_{\mathbb R}\) is just a copy of \(\mathbb R\).
But the vertical line does not have a (finite) slope, so \(\mathbb P^1_{\mathbb R} = \mathbb R \cup \{\infty\}\).
In other words, \(\mathbb P^1\) contains the usual real line, plus &ldquo;a point at infinity&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
It can be more instructive to see this in a picture.
Fix a horizontal line \(L\) at, say, \(y = -1\).
Every line through the origin intersects \(L\) at a unique point, except the horizontal line.
So if we discard the one point of \(\mathbb P^1_k\) corresponding to the horizontal line, the rest is just a copy of \(L\).
If we had chosen a different reference line \(L\), for example, a vertical one, then we get a similar description of \(\mathbb P^1\) away from a single point.
In fact, we can discard <i>any</i> one point of \(\mathbb P^1\), and the rest will be a copy of \(\mathbb R\).
</p>

<p>
Let us take \(n = 2\).
Then \(\mathbb P^2_k\) is the set of lines (through the origin) in \(k^3\).
We can use the same technique as before: fix a reference plane \(P\) at \(z = -1\).
Then most lines are uniquely characterised by their intersection point with \(P\).
The only exceptions are the lines parallel to \(z = -1\), that is, the lines lying in the plane \(z = 0\), which we miss.
But these form a small projective space \(\mathbb P^1\).
So we see that \(\mathbb P^2 = P \sqcup \mathbb P^1\).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-2-3">
<p>
A one-dimensional subspace of \(k^{n+1}\) is spanned by a non-zero vector \((a_0,\dots,a_n)\).
Two vectors \((a_0,\dots,a_n)\) and \((b_0,\dots,b_n)\) span the same subspace if and only if there exists  \(\lambda \in k^\times\) such that
\[ (b_0,\dots,b_n) = (\lambda a_0, \dots, \lambda a_n).\]
So, we can identify \(\mathbb P^n\) with the equivalence classes of non-zero vectors \((a_0, \dots, a_n)\) where two non-zero vectors are considered equivalent if one is a scalar multiple of the other.
In other words, we have
\[ \mathbb P^n_k = (\mathbb A^{n+1} \setminus 0)/{\rm scaling}.\]
We denote the equivalence class of \((a_0,\dots,a_n)\) by \([a_0:\dots:a_n]\).
</p>

<p>
We give \(\mathbb P^n_k\) the quotient topology inherited from \(\mathbb A^{n+1} \setminus 0.\)
That is, a set \(U \subset \mathbb P^n_k\) is open/closed if and only if its pre-image in \(\mathbb A^{n+1} \setminus 0\) is open/closed.
</p>

<p>
For example, consider the subset \(U_n\) of \(\mathbb P^n_k\) consisting of \([a_0:\dots:a_n]\) with \(a_n \neq 0\).
Its preimage in the set of \((a_0,\dots,a_n) \in \mathbb A^{n+1} \setminus 0\) with \(a_n \neq 0\), which is a (Zariski) open set.
Hence \(U_n\) is open in \(\mathbb P^n_k\).
Likewise, \(U_0, U_1, \dots\) are also open.
Note that we have
\[ \mathbb P^n_k = U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n;\]
that is, the sets \(U_0, \dots, U_n\) form an open cover of \(\mathbb P^n\).
</p>

<p>
Consider a point \([a_0:\dots:a_n] \in U_0\), so that \(a_0 \neq 0\).
By scaling by \(\lambda = a_0^{-1}\), we have a distinguished representative of this point of the form \([1:b_1:\dots:b_n]\), which we can think of as a point \((b_1,\dots,b_n) \in \mathbb A^n\).
Thus, we have a bijection \(\phi_0 \colon U_0 \to \mathbb A^n\), and similarly \(\phi_1 U_i \to \mathbb A^n\).

\((\varphi_{j}\circ\varphi_{i}^{-1})^{-1}=\varphi_{i}\circ\varphi_{j}^{-1}=(f^1_{ji},...,f^n_{ji})\) is also regular, therefore all \(\varphi_{j}\circ\varphi_{i}^{-1}\) are biregular.

Then \(Y\) inherits the structure of an algebraic variety.
To get, the atlas for \(Y\), let \(\phi_i \colon U_i \to V_i\)  be an atlas for \(X\).
For \(Y\), we just take \(\phi_i \colon U_i \cap Y \to \phi(U_i \cap Y).\)
</p>
<div class="skipped" id="orgf5cf104">
<p>
Explain why this is an atlas for \(Y\).
</p>

<div class="proof" id="org99988e8">
<p>
Suppose \(Y\) is a closed subset of \(X\).
First, we need to show that \(\{U_i \cap Y\}\) is an open covering of \(Y\):
Since \(\bigcup U_i = X\), \(\bigcup(U_i \cap Y) = Y\) and \(\{U_i \cap Y\}\) covers \(Y\).
Also, \(Y\) is a subspace of \(X\) implies \(U_i \cap Y\) is open in \(Y\).
[ By the definition of topological subspace]
Then we need to prove \(\phi_i (U_i \cap Y)\) is a quasi-affine variety:
Since \(U_i \cap Y \subset U_i\) and \(U_i\) is a subspace of \(X\), \(U_i \cap Y\) is closed in \(U_i\).
Given that \(\phi_i\) is a homeomorphism, \(\phi_i (U_i \cap Y)\) is also closed in \(V_i\).
Since a closed subset of quasi-affine varieties is also a quasi-affine
variety, \(\phi_i (U_i \cap Y)\) is a quasi-affine variety.
Thus, \(\phi_i : U_i\cap Y \to \phi_i(Ui \cap Y)\) is a chart for \(Y\).
And if we restrict the original transition maps on \(U_i \cap Y\), the new
transition maps are still bi-regular.
Hence \(\{\phi_i : U_i \cap Y \to \phi_i(U_i \cap Y)\}\) is a quasi-affine atlas for \(Y\) and \(Y\) is
also an algebraic variety with inherited structure from \(X\).
The case when \(Y\) is an open subset of \(X\) is similar.

We conclude using Homework 1 that \(C = V(I)\) for a homogeneous ideal \(I\), and prove that \(X = V(I)\) in \(\mathbb P^n\).
The details are below.
</p>

</div>
<div class="skipped" id="org1c0d873">
<p>
Suppose that \(X\) is non-empty. Let \(\pi : \mathbb{A}^{n+1} \setminus \{\mathbf{0}\} \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^n\) be the quotient map. Then \(\pi^{-1}(X)\) is closed in \(\mathbb{A}^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}\). Let \(C \subseteq \mathbb{A}^{n+1}\) be the closure of \(\pi^{-1}(X)\) in \(\mathbb{A}^{n+1}\). Let \(p \in k[X_0, \dots, X_n]\) with \(p(\mathbf{y}) = 0\) for all \(\mathbf{y} \in \pi^{-1}(X)\). Let \([\mathbf{x}] \in X\) for some \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{A}^{n+1}\setminus\{\mathbf{0}\}\). Then \(\lambda \mathbf{x} \in \pi^{-1}(X)\) for all \(\lambda \in k\) with \(\lambda \ne 0\). Let \(p = p_d + \dots + p_0\) be the decomposition of \(p\) into its homogeneous components. Define \(q \in k[Y]\) by \(q(Y) = Y^dp_d(\mathbf{x}) + \dots +Y p_1(\mathbf{x}) + p_0(\mathbf{x})\). Let \(\lambda \in k\) with \(\lambda \ne 0\).
</p>
\begin{align*}
    q(\lambda) &= \lambda^dp_d(\mathbf{x}) + \dots + \lambda p_1(\mathbf{x}) + p_0(\mathbf{x}) \\
    &= p_d(\lambda\mathbf{x}) + \dots + p_1(\lambda\mathbf{x}) + p_0(\lambda\mathbf{x}) \\
    &= p(\lambda\mathbf{x}) \\
    &= 0
\end{align*}
<p>
So \(q\) has infinitely many roots and therefore \(q\) is the zero polynomial. This gives that \(p_0(\mathbf{x}) = 0\) and so \(p_0\) is the zero constant.
</p>
\begin{align*}
    p(\mathbf{0}) &= p_d(\mathbf{0}) + \dots + p_0(\mathbf{0}) \\
    &= p_0(\mathbf{0}) \\
    &= 0
\end{align*}
<p>
So \(\mathbf{0}\) is a root of \(p\). Therefore \(\mathbf{0}\) is an element of \(C\), so \(C = \pi^{-1}(X)\cup\{0\}\).
So for all \(\lambda \in k\) we have that \(\lambda\mathbf{x} \in C\). Then by Homework 1 we have that \(C = V(I)\) where \(I \subseteq k[X_0, \dots, X_n]\) is a homogeneous ideal.
</p>
\begin{align*}
    \pi(V(I) \setminus \{0\}) &= \pi(\pi^{-1}(X)) \\
    &= X
\end{align*}
<p>
Therefore \(X = V(I)\) where \(V(I)\) is identified as a subset of \(\mathbb{P}^n\).
</p>

<p>
Now suppose that \(X\) is empty. Then \(X\) is the image of the empty set under \(\pi\). The empty set is the vanishing set of the unit ideal, which is homogeneous.
</p>

<p>
Therefore there exists a homogeneous ideal \(I \subseteq k[X_0, \dots, X_n]\) such that \(X = V(I)\).

Let \(X\) be an algebraic variety and \(f \colon X \to k\) a function.

Consider the functions \(f \circ \phi_1^{-1} \colon V_1 \to k\) and \(f \circ \phi_2^{-1} \colon V_2 \to k\).
Then the first is regular at \(v_1\) if and only if the second is regular at \(v_2\).
</p>
<div class="skipped" id="orgde83761">

<div class="proof" id="orge1c09fd">
<p>
Suppose \(X\) is an algebraic variety and that \(f : X \to k\) is a function. Suppose \(x \in X\) lies in the domains \(U_1\) and \(U_2\) of two compatible charts \(\phi_1 : U_1 \to V_1\) and \(\phi_2 : U_2 \to V_2\). Let \(v_1 = \phi_1(x)\) and \(v_2 = \phi_2(x)\). We prove that \(f \circ \phi_{1}^{-1} : V_1 \to K\) is regular at \(v_1\) if and only if \(f \circ \phi_{2}^{-1} : V_2 \to K\) is regular at \(v_2\).
</p>

<p>
Suppose that \(f \circ \phi_{1}^{-1} : V_1 \to K\) is regular at \(v_1\). We write
</p>
\begin{equation} \label{1}
f \circ \phi_{2}^{-1} = (f \circ \phi_{1}^{-1}) \circ (\phi_{1} \circ \phi_{2}^{-1}).
\end{equation}
<p>
Note that the right-hand side of \((\ref{1})\) makes sense as a map from \(\phi_2(U_1 \cap U_2)\) not from all of \(V_2\) to all of \(V_1\). This is no cause for concern though, since regularity is a local property. Note that \((\phi_{1} \circ \phi_{2}^{-1})(v_2) = v_1\). By compatibility of the charts, we know that \(\phi_1 \circ \phi_{2}^{-1}\) is regular. Using this and the assumption that \(f \circ \phi_{1}^{-1}\) is regular at \(v_1\), we find that the composition on the right-hand side of \((\ref{1})\) is regular at \(v_2\). That is, the restriction of \(f \circ \phi_{2}^{-1}\) is regular at \(v_2\). Since regularity is a local property, we have that \(f \circ \phi_{2}^{-1}\) is regular at \(v_2\).
</p>

<p>
The proof of the converse implication is exactly the same, with equation \((\ref{1})\) replaced by
\[
f \circ \phi_{1}^{-1} = (f \circ \phi_{2}^{-1}) \circ (\phi_{2} \circ \phi_{1}^{-1}).
\]
For the converse implication, we again use compatibility of the maps \(\phi_1\) and \(\phi_2\). We establish that the composition on the right-hand side of \((\ref{2})\) is regular at \(v_1\). Accordingly, \(f \circ \phi_{1}^{-1}\) is regular at \(v_1\). This completes the proof.

and write our homogenous vector as a column vector, then the map is
\[ [X] \mapsto [LX].\]
In other words, it is induced by the invertible linear map \(L \colon V \to V\).
As a result, it has an inverse, induced by the inverse of the matrix \(M\):
\[ [X] \mapsto [MX].\]
In this way, we get an action of \(GL_n(k)\) on \(\mathbb P^n\).
But notice that a matrix \(L\) and a scalar multiple \(\lambda L\) induce the same map on \(\mathbb P^n\).
So the action descends to an action of the group \(PGL_n(k) = GL_n(k) / \rm{scalars}.\)

The image of \(v_n\) is a closed subset of \(C\) of \(\mathbb P^n\).
If we denote the homogeneous coordinates on \(\mathbb P^n\) by \([U_0:\dots: U_n]\), then \(C\) is cut out by the equations

</p>

<div class="proof" id="org5ba5d2b">
<p>
\(\boxed{\subset}\) Let \(U = [u_0:\ldots:u_n] \in v_n(\mathbb{P}^1)\). Then by definition of \(v_n\), we have for all \(0\leq i\leq n\) that \(u_i = x^{n-i}y^i\) for some \(x,y \in k\). Then for all \(0 \leq i,j,k,l \leq n\) satisfying \(i+j = k+l\) we have 
</p>
\begin{align*}
    u_iu_j - u_ku_l &= x^{n-i}y^ix^{n-j}y^j - x^{n-k}y^kx^{n-l}y^l \\
    &= x^{2n-(i+j)}y^{i+j} - x^{2n-(k+l)}y^{k+l} \\
    &= x^{2n-(i+j)}y^{i+j} - x^{2n-(i+j)}y^{i+j} \tag*{by $i+j = k+l$} \\
    &= 0.
\end{align*}

<p>
So \(U \in v_n(\mathbb{P}^1)\) satisfies all the given equations and hence \(U \in C\).
</p>

<p>
\(\boxed{\supset}\) Given any element of \(C\), we want to find an element of \(\mathbb{P}^2\) which maps to \(U\) via \(v_n\). I claim that elements of \(C\) can be categorised into three classes:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(U=[1:0:\ldots:0]\)</li>
<li>\(U=[0:\ldots:0:1]\)</li>
<li>\(U=[u_0:\ldots:u_n]\) with all \(u_i\) nonzero.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<i>Proof of classification</i>.
    To see this, we first show that \(U\) cannot have both \(u_0\) and \(u_n\) zero. Suppose this is the case with \(u_0=u_n=0\). Then consider the following procedure which shows that every other \(u_i\) must be zero.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let \(S = \{1,\ldots,n-1\}\) represent the induces for which \(u_i\) are nonzero.</li>
<li>While \(S\) is nonempty:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Choose any \(i \in S\).</li>
<li>Let \(l, r \in \{0,\ldots,n\} \setminus S\) be the largest and smallest elements respectively such that \(l \leq i \leq r\).</li>
<li>By definition of \(S\), we have \(u_l = u_r = 0\). So by the condition on \(C\), we have \(u_iu_{l+r-i}=u_lu_r=0\), so either \(u_i\) or \(u_{l+r-i}\) is zero. Remove from \(S\) the corresponding index \(i\) or \(l+r-i\).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that when this procedure terminates, \(S\) becomes nonempty and we get that \(U=[0:\ldots:0]\) which is not a valid element of the projective space. It should be clear from construction that the procedure indeed terminates and is valid as in each step we can always find lower and upper bounds \(l,r\) not in \(S\) for any chosen \(i\). Moreover, since no element \(u_i\) with \(l \leq i \leq r\) has yet to be shown to be zero, each iteration of the while loop indeed removes an element of \(S\) as \(l \leq l+r-i \leq r\) for \(l\leq i \leq r\).
The following equation illustrates an example of the procedure.
</p>
\begin{align*}
        &[0: u_1 : u_2:u_3:u_4: 0] \\
        &[0: u_1 : 0:u_3:u_4: 0] \tag*{$i=2, l=0, r=5$}\\
        &[0: u_1 : 0:0:u_4: 0] \tag*{$i=3, l=2, r=5$}\\
        &[0: 0 : 0:0:u_4: 0] \tag*{$i=1, l=0, r=2$}\\
        &[0: 0 : 0:0:0: 0] \tag*{$i=4, l=3, r=5$}
\end{align*}

<p>
A similar argument can be used to classify elements of \(U\) as described above. For (1) and (2), suppose without loss of generality that \(u_0 = 1\). Then the exact same procedure above still shows that \(u_1=\ldots=u_n=0\) except we note that \(0 \notin S\) no longer means that \(u_0=0\) but is simply used to help argue that every other element is zero.
</p>

<p>
For (3), we now suppose \(u_0\) and \(u_n\) are nonzero. Now suppose \(u_j = 0\) for some \(0 < j < n\) in order to derive a contradiction. But by the condition on \(C\), we have \(u_0u_n = u_ju_{n-j} = 0\), implying that either \(u_0\) or \(u_n\) is zero which contradicts our assumption.
</p>

<p>
Having classified the elements of \(C\), we now show what elements map to them under \(v_n\). In case (1), we have 
</p>
\begin{align*}
    v_n([1:0]) = [1:0:\ldots:0]
\end{align*}
<p>
and similarly for case (2), we have
</p>
\begin{align*}
    v_n([0:1]) = [0:\ldots:0:1].
\end{align*}

<p>
For case (3), I claim that 
</p>
\begin{align*}
    v_n([u_0, u_1]) = [u_0:\ldots:u_n].
\end{align*}

<p>
We have that \(v_n([u_0, u_1]) = [w_0:\ldots:w_n]\) with \(w_i = u_0^{n-i}u_1^i\). To show that \([u_0:\ldots:u_n] = [w_0:\ldots:w_n]\), we want to show that these elements viewed as vectors are linearly dependent, or equivalently
</p>
\begin{align*}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        u_0&\ldots&u_n\\
        w_0&\ldots&w_n
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
<p>
has rank 1, or equivalently again in linear algebra that all \(2\times 2\) minors vanish. This is the same as showing that for all \(0\leq i, j\leq n\) that \(u_iw_j = u_jw_i\). However since each \(u\) and hence \(w\) component is nonzero, it suffices to show that \(u_iw_{i+1} = u_{i+1}w_i\) for all \(0\leq i<n\) as multiplying these equations together gives us \[u_iu_{i+1}\ldots u_{j-1} w_{i+1}\ldots w_{j-1}w_{j} = w_{i}w_{i+1}\ldots w_{j-1}u_{i+1}\ldots u_{j-1}u_j\]
which when divided by the nonzero element \(u_{i+1}\ldots u_{j-1} w_{i+1}\ldots w_{j-1}\) gives us \(u_iw_j = u_jw_i\).
</p>

<p>
But for all \(0 \leq i < n\) we have
</p>
\begin{align*}
    u_iw_{i+1} 
    &= u_iu_0^{n-i-1}u_1^{i+1} \\
    &= u_0^{n-i-1}u_1^{i} \cdot u_iu_1 \\
    &= u_0^{n-i-1}u_1^{i} \cdot u_{i+1}u_0 \tag*{by condition from $C$} \\
    &= u_{i+1}u_0^{n-i}u_1^i \\
    &= u_{i+1}w_i
\end{align*}
<p>
so indeed we have $v<sub>n</sub>([u<sub>0</sub>, u<sub>1</sub>]) = [w<sub>0</sub>:\ldots:w<sub>n</sub>] = [u<sub>0</sub>:\ldots:u<sub>n</sub>].$

The map \(v_n \colon \mathbb P^1 \to C\) is in fact an isomorphism. 
</p>
<div class="skipped" id="org82ec7b6">
<p>
Define the inverse map.
</p>

<div class="proof" id="orge4f37e0">
<p>
The inverse map \(w_n : C \to \mathbb{P}^1\) is defined as
</p>
\begin{align*}
w_n([U_0, \ldots, U_n]) = &[U_i : U_{i+1}] \\
& \text{ if } U_i \not= 0 \text{ or } U_{i+1} \not= 0  \text{ for } i=0,\ldots,n-1
\end{align*}
<p>
To see that the map is well defined, observe that if \([U_0, \ldots, U_n] \in C\), then it must satisfy
\[
U_iU_j - U_kU_l = 0 \text{ for } i+j = k+l
\]
so in particular we have that for \(i,j = 1,\ldots,n-1\),
\[
[U_i : U_{i+1}] = [U_j : U_{j+1}]
\]
since \(U_iU_{j+1} - U_{i+1}U_j = 0\). 
</p>

<p>
Now, I claim that \(w_n\) is the inverse map of \(v_n\). To see this, notice that
</p>
\begin{align*}
    w_n \circ v_n ([X : Y]) &= w_n([X^n : X^{n-1}Y : \ldots : Y^n]) \\
    &= [X^{n} : X^{n-1}Y] \\
    &= [X : Y]
\end{align*}
<p>
where the second line follows from the fact that at least one of \(X\) or \(Y\) is nonzero. Thus, \(w_n \circ v_n\) is the identity on \(\mathbb P^1\).
</p>

<p>
For the other direction, we have
</p>
\begin{align*}
    v_n \circ w_n([U_0 : \ldots : U_n]) &= v_n([U_i : U_{i+1}]) \\
    &= [U_i^n : \ldots : U_{i+1}^n]
\end{align*}
<p>
Now I claim that in \(\mathbb P^n\), \([U_0 : \ldots : U_n] = [U_i^n : \ldots : U_{i+1}^n]\). To check this, we need to show that all the cross terms are equal. Let \(j,k \in \{0,\ldots,n\}\) and suppose without loss of generality that \(k - j = m > 0\). Then we have that \(j^{th}\) and \(k^{th}\) cross terms are equal if and only if
</p>
\begin{align*}
    U_j (U_i^{n-k} U_{i+1}^k) &= U_k (U_i^{n-j} U_{i+1}^j) \\
    \iff U_j U_{i+1}^{k-j} &= U_k U_{i}^{k-j} \\
    \iff U_j U_{i+1}^{m} &= U_{j+m} U_{i}^{m}
\end{align*}
<p>
But we know that \(U_j U_{i+1} = U_{j+1} U_i\), by the construction of \(C\). Hence, it follows by induction that \(U_j U_{i+1}^{m} = U_{j+m} U_{i}^{m}\). Therefore,
\[
U_j U_i^{n-k} U_{i+1}^k = U_k U_i^{n-j} U_{i+1}^j
\]
so the \(j^{th}\) and \(k^{th}\) cross terms are equal. We can repeat the same argument for \(k < j\). Thus, \([U_0 : \ldots : U_n] = [U_i^n : \ldots : U_{i+1}^n]\), so it follows that \(v_n \circ w_n\) is the identity on \(C\).
</p>

<p>
This concludes the proof that \(w_n\) is the inverse map of \(v_n\).
</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>
The proposition above generalises to all dimensions.
Consider the \(k\)-vector space of degree \(n\) homogeneous polynomials in \(X_0, \dots, X_m\).
It has dimension \(N = {n+m \choose m}\).
Choosing a basis gives a map \(\mathbb P^m \to \mathbb P^N\).
The image of this map is a closed subvariety \(Z\) and the map \(\mathbb P^m \to Z\) is an isomorphism.
The equations of \(Z\) and the description of the inverse map are analogous to the \(m = 1\) case, but (understandably) somewhat more cumbersome.

If \(X\) and \(Y\) are algebraic varieties, then their product set \(X \times Y\) is naturally an algebraic variety.  This, in theory, should be completely straightforward (and it is), but you have to be slightly careful because the Zariski topology of \(X \times Y\) is <i>not</i> the product topology.
</p>

<p>
First, suppose \(X = \mathbb A^m\) and \(Y = \mathbb A^n\), then \(X \times Y = \mathbb A^{m+n}\) is an algebraic variety.  Observe that the Zariski topology on \(\mathbb A^{m+n}\) is <i>not</i> the product topology.
</p>

<p>
Second, if \(X \subset \mathbb A^m\) and \(Y \subset \mathbb A^m\) are both closed (or open), then \(X \times Y \subset \mathbb A^{m+n}\) is closed (or open), so it is naturally an algebraic variety.

</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>
Third, by combining the cases of closed/open and taking intersections, we get that if \(X\) and \(Y\) are locally closed, then \(X \times Y \subset \mathbb A^{m+n}\) is also locally closed, and hence an algebraic variety.  So the case of quasi-affine varieties is done.
</p>

<p>
In general, suppose \(X\) has the quasi-affine atlas \(\{\phi_i \colon U_i \to V_i\}\) and \(Y\) has the quasi-affine atlas \(\{\phi'_j \colon U'_j \to V'_j\}\).  Then the product \(X \times Y\) is covered by the sets \(U_i \times U'_j\).  We <i>declare</i> the product map \(U_i \times U'_j \to V_i \times V'_j\) to be a homeomorphism; that is, we give \(U_i \times U'_j\) the Zariski topology of \(V_i \times V'_j\).
Then, we declare a set \(Z \subset X \times Y\) to be closed (or open) if and only if for all \(i,j\), the intersection \(Z \cap U_i \times U'_j\) is closed (or open) in \(U_i \times U'_j\).
It is easy to check that this gives \(X \times Y\) a topology under which \(U_i \times U'_j\) is an open cover, and the maps
\[\phi_i \times \phi'_j \colon U_i \times U'_j \to V_i \times V'_j \]
are a family of compatible charts.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-4">
<p>
The Segre embedding is a closed embedding of \(\mathbb P^n \times \mathbb P^m\) in a bigger projective space.
It is a cool example, but it is also of theoretical importance.
The most studied and the most well-behaved varieties are projective varieties (varieties isomorphic to closed subsets of projective space) or somewhat more generally quasi-projective varieties (varieties isomorphic to locally closed subsets of projective space).
The Segre embedding shows that this class of varieties is closed under products.
</p>

<p>
Let \(N = (m+1)(n+1)-1.\)
Consider the Segre map \(\mathbb P^n \times \mathbb P^m \to \mathbb P^{N}\) defined by
\[ [X_0, \dots, X_n], [Y_0, \dots, Y_m] \mapsto [X_i \cdot Y_j].\]
It is easy to check that this map is regular.
</p>

<p>
A good way to think about this map is as follows.
Think of elements of \(\mathbb P^n\) as row vectors up to scaling, \(\mathbb P^m\) as column vectors (up to scaling), and \(\mathbb P^n\) as \((n+1) \times (m+1)\)-matrices up to scaling.
Then the product \(XY\) of \(X \in \mathbb P^n\) and \(Y \in \mathbb P^m\) is an \((n+1) \times (m+1)\) matrix, which taken up to scaling, defines an element of \(\mathbb P^N\).
Observe that matrix \(XY\) has rank \(1\), and hence the Segre map lands in the subspace \(Z \subset \mathbb P^N\) corresponding to matrices of rank 1.
</p>

<p>
Now, a rank 1 matrix can be written as a product \(XY\), and up to scaling, such an expression is unique.
As a result, the Segre map is a bijection from \(\mathbb P^n \times \mathbb P^m \to Z\).
But more is true.
</p>

<p>
The rank 1 locus \(Z \subset \mathbb P^N\) is closed, and the Segre map \(\mathbb P^n \times \mathbb P^m \to Z\) is a bi-regular isomorphism.
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orge2bf46d">
<p>
Consider an \((n+1) \times (m+1)\) matrix \(M\).
Then \(M\) has rank 1 if and only if all \(2 \times 2\) minors of \(M\) vanish.
Hence, \(Z\) is the zero-locus of all \(2 \times 2\)-minors, which are homogeneous polynomials in the entries of the matrix.
</p>

<p>
To prove that the Segre map is an isomorphism onto \(Z\), we must construct a regular inverse \(Z \to \mathbb P^n \times \mathbb P^m\).
We do this below.
</p>

</div>

<div class="skipped" id="org91c0763">
<p>
Do it!
</p>

<div class="proof" id="org55777fb">
<p>
We have that \(Z\) is the matrices of rank 1 taken up to scaling. Let \(M\in Z\), and define a map \(\phi:Z\to\mathbb{P}^n\times\mathbb{P}^m\) such that \(\phi(M)=(ColM, RowM)\), where \(ColM\) is any non-zero column in \(M\) and \(RowM\) is any non-zero row. 
</p>

<p>
To show that this map is well-defined, suppose there exist two distinct non-zero columns, \(ColM\) and \(Col'M\) in \(M\), and also two distinct rows, \(RowM\) and \(Row'M\), in \(M\). Since \(M\) has rank 1, all rows are linearly dependent, and all columns are independent. So \(Col'M\) is a scalar multiple of \(ColM\), and thus they define the same element of \(\mathbb{P}^n\). Similarly, \(Row'M\) is a scalar multiple of \(RowM\) and so they define the same element of \(\mathbb{P}^m\). So as elements of \(\mathbb{P}^n\times\mathbb{P}^m\), \((Col'M,Row'M)\) is equal to \((ColM,RowM)\). So then our map is well-defined. 
</p>

<p>
To check our map is an inverse, we define \(\psi\) to be the Segre map from \(\mathbb{P}^n\times\mathbb{P}^m\) to \(Z\). 
</p>

<p>
Then \(\psi\circ\phi(M)=\psi(ColM,RowM)=M\), since \(M\) has rank 1, so the product \(ColM\cdot RowM\) defines \(M\) up to scaling. 
</p>

<p>
Also, \(\phi\circ\psi(X,Y)=\phi(XY)=(X,Y)\), since \(X\) and \(Y\) must be non-zero and the well-defined property of \(\phi\) tells us we can take \(X=Col(XY)\) and \(Y=Row(XY)\). 
</p>

<p>
So \(\phi\circ\psi=id_{\mathbb{P}^n\times\mathbb{P}^m}\) and \(\psi\circ\phi=id_Z\). 
</p>

<p>
To show \(\phi\) is regular, note that the component map \(Z\to\mathbb{P}^n\) is regular since under any charts, \(\phi\) defines a polynomial map. Similarly, the component map \(Z\to\mathbb{P}^m\) is a polynomial map in affine coordinates and thus regular. So then \(\phi\) is regular, and since both the component maps are polynomials in affine coordinates, \(\phi\) is also a homomorphism. 
</p>

<p>
So \(\phi\) defines a regular inverse for the Segre map, and therefore the Segre map \(\mathbb{P}^n\times\mathbb{P}^m\to Z\) is a bi-regular isomorphism.

Suppose \(X\) and \(Y\) are projective, say \(X \subset \mathbb P^n\) is closed and \(Y \subset \mathbb P^m\) is closed.

Describe the equations that cut out the image.
Conclude that every non-degenerate quadric in \(\mathbb P^3\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb P^1\).
</p>

<div class="proof" id="orga7955b3">
<p>
Treat elements of \(\mathbb{P}^{3}\) as \(2 \times 2\) matrices up to scaling, that is, of the form \(\begin{pmatrix} X_{0} & X_{1}\\ X_{2} & X_{3} \end{pmatrix}\). The image of the Segre embedding is \(V(X_{0}X_{3} - X_{1}X_{2})\), that is, where the above matrix has zero determinant. \(\mathbb{P}^{1} \times \mathbb{P}^{1}\) is isomorphic to its image under the Segre embedding.<br />
</p>

<p>
Now the polynomial \(X_{0}X_{3} - X_{1}X_{2}\) is homogeneous of degree 2 (a quadratic form). In a field of characteristic not equal to 2, any quadratic form
\[\sum_{i \leq j} a_{ij}X_{i}X_{j} = \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{1}{2}a_{ij}X_{i}X_{j} + \sum_{i} a_{ii}X_{i}^{2}.\]
This can be written as \(\text{x}^{T}A \text{x}\), where \(A\) is a symmetric \((n + 1) \times (n + 1)\) matrix. Define a symmetric inner product \(\langle \, , \rangle\) by \(\langle \text{x}, \text{y} \rangle = \text{x}^{T}A\text{y}\). This inner product can be diagonalised by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation.<br />
</p>

<p>
In this case, we have
\[ A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2}\\ 0 & 0 & -\frac{1}{2} & 0\\ 0 & -\frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0\\ \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.\]
Hence, \(\text{rank}(A) = 4\), which means that our quadratic form is non-degenerate. It can be written as \(\tilde{X}_{0}^{2} + \tilde{X}_{1}^{2} + \tilde{X}_{2}^{2} + \tilde{X}_{3}^{2}\), where \(\tilde{X}_{0} = \frac{1}{2}(X_{0} + X_{3}), \tilde{X}_{1} = \frac{1}{2}(X_{1} - X_{2}), \tilde{X}_{2} = -\frac{1}{2}i(X_{1} + X_{2}), \tilde{X}_{3} = -\frac{1}{2}i(X_{0} - X_{3})\). The use of \(i\) is justified since our field is algebraically closed. Consequently, every non-degenerate quadratic (in a field of characteristic not equal to 2) can be written in the form \(X_{0}X_{3} - X_{1}X_{2}\). Therefore, every non-degenerate quadratic in \(\mathbb{P}^{3}\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{P}^{1} \times \mathbb{P}^{1}\).

Are \(\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb P^1\) and \(\mathbb P^2\) isomorphic?
Use whatever tools you have over your favourite field to answer this.
</p>

<div class="proof" id="orga175e46">
<p>
Suppose the base field is \(\mathbb C\).
Then every variety has a topology coming from the standard (Euclidean) topology on \(\mathbb C\).
Since polynomial functions are continuous in the Euclidean topology, regular maps between varieties over \(\mathbb C\) are continuous functions in the Euclidean topology.
A regular isomorphism between \(\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb P^1\) and \(\mathbb P^2\) would give a homeomorphism between the two corresponding topological spaces \(\mathbb C \mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb C \mathbb P^1 \to \mathbb C \mathbb P^2\).
But from topology, we know that these two topological spaces are not homeomorphic (one reason: they have non-isomorphic homology groups).
</p>

<p>
Surprisingly, the argument above <b>can</b> be made to work over an arbitrary field.
There is a version of homology groups for varieties that can be defined purely algebraically, and hence over any field.
These are called Chow groups.
Once you develop this theory, it is quite easy to compute the Chow groups of \(\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb P^1\) and \(\mathbb P^2\), and see that they are non-isomorphic.
Unfortunately, we won&rsquo;t get to the definition of Chow groups in this class.
</p>

<p>
A more elementary proof that we will get to is the following. We will prove that there do not exist any non-constant regular maps from \(\mathbb P^n\) to \(\mathbb P^m\) if \(n > m\).
Then it follows that \(\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb P^1\) and \(\mathbb P^2\) are not isomorphic&#x2014;the former has a non-constant map to \(\mathbb P^1\) but the latter doesn&rsquo;t.

Let \(X\) be a quasi-projective variety. We may assume that \(X \subset \mathbb{P}^n\). Let \(\phi:X\to X\times X\) and \(\psi:\mathbb{P}^n\to \mathbb{P}^n\times \mathbb{P}^n\) denote the diagonal maps, noting that \(\phi(x)=\psi(x)\) for all \(x\in X\).

Suppose now that \(y\in (X\times X)\cap \psi(\mathbb{P}^n)\). Then there is \(x\in \mathbb{P}^n\) such that \(\psi(x)=y\). That is, \(y=(x,x)\), so \(x\in X\) because \(y\in X\times X\).

It follows that \(\phi(X)= (X\times X)\cap \psi(\mathbb{P}^n)\), which is closed in \(X\times X\) because \(\psi(\mathbb{P}^n)\) is closed in \(\mathbb{P}^n\times \mathbb{P}^n\), by 1.4.7. That is, \(X\) is separated.

\[V_J^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}c&d\\1&0\end{bmatrix}^{-1}=\frac{1}{d}\begin{bmatrix}0&d\\1&-c\end{bmatrix}\]

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-3">
<p>
There is a way to embed Grassmannians as closed subsets of projective spaces.
In due course, we&rsquo;ll see that projective varieties (varieties isomorphic to closed subsets of projective spaces) are the best varieties, and the Plucker embedding shows that Grassmannians are in the club.
</p>

<p>
The map is simple.
It goes
\[ p \colon {\rm Gr}(m,n) \to \mathbb P^{N},\]
where \(N = {n \choose m} - 1.\)
Take an \(m\)-dimensional subspace \(v\) of \(k^n\) represented by an \(n \times m\) matrix \(V\).
Define
\[ p(v) = [{\rm det} V_I],\]
where \(I\) ranges over all \(m\)-element subsets of \({1, \dots, n}\).
This is well-defined.
First of all, not all determinants are 0, because \(V\) has rank \(m\).
Secondly, a different representative of \(v\) has the form \(V A\), where \(A\) is an invertible \(m \times m\) matrix, but then all the determinants are multiplied by the same scalar, namely \({\rm det} A\).
</p>
<div class="skipped" id="org7267bc4">
<p>
To show that the Plucker map is regular, we need to prove that for all points \(v\in \operatorname{Gr}(m,n)\), the composite map \(\psi \circ p \circ \phi^{-1} : V \dashrightarrow V'\) is regular at \(\phi(v)\).
</p>

<p>
Fix some \(v\in \operatorname{Gr}(m,n)\). We know that there exists some representative matrix \(V\) such that there exists an $m$-element subset \(I\subset \{1,...,n\}\) for which \(V_I\) is the identity matrix. Thus \(\det V_I=1\). Choosing the chart of \(\mathbb{P}^N\) associated with dividing through by \(\det V_I\), we have that \(\psi_I \circ p \circ \phi^{-1}_I\) maps element \(V_{I^C}\in \mathbb{A}^{m(n-m)}\) to \((\det V_J)\) where \(J\) ranges over all \(m\) element subsets of \(\{1,...,n\}\) excluding \(J=I\). Noting that the determinant is a polynomial, we can conclude \(\psi_I \circ p \circ \phi^{-1}_I\) is a regular map. \qed

Let \(Y = X - Z\).

For \(2 \implies 3\), assume that every non-empty open is dense and let \(U, V \subset X\) be non-empty open subsets. Pick a \(v \in V\). Then \(v\) lies in the closure of \(U\), so any open subset containing \(v\) must intersect \(U\). In particular, \(V\) intersects \(U\).

By taking complements, we have \(Y^c \cap Z^c = \varnothing\), and hence either \(Y^c\) or \(Z^c\) is empty. But by assumption \(Y^c\) is non-empty, so \(Z^c\) must be empty. In other words, we have \(Z = X\).

Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be irreducible varieties.  Then \(X \times Y\) is irreducible.

<div class="proof" id="org5a9358d">
<p>
Suppose \(X \times Y = Z_1 \cup Z_2\), where \(Z_i \subset X \times Y\) are closed.  Let us show that \(Z_i = X \times Y\) for \(i = 1\) or \(2\).
For every \(y \in Y\), we have
\[ X \times y = Z_1 \cap (X \times y) \cup Z_2 \cap (X \times y).\]
Since \(X \cong X \times y\) is irreducible, we have \(Z_i \cap (X \times y) = X \times y\) for \(i = 1\) or \(2\); that is, we have \(X \times y \subset Z_i\) for \(i = 1\) or \(2\) (or both).
Let \(W_i \subset Y\) be the set of \(y\) such that \(X \times y \subset Z_i\).
Then \(Y = W_1 \cup W_2\).
We can also see that \(W_i \subset Y\) is closed: it can be written as the intersection
\[
W_i = \bigcap_{x \in X} \{y \in Y \mid (x,y) \in Z_i\},
\]
in which each set is closed.
Since \(Y\) is irreducible and \(Y = W_1 \cup W_2\), we see that \(Y = W_i\) for \(i = 1\) or \(2\).
This means \(X \times Y = Z_i\) for \(i = 1\) or \(2\).

<p>
Let \(X \subset \mathbb P^n\) be an irreducible subset.
Then the cone \(C \subset \mathbb A^{n+1}\) over \(X\) is closed.
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org6b68774">
<p>
Recall that the cone \(C\) is the closure of \(\pi^{-1}(X)\) where \(\pi \colon \mathbb A^{n+1} \setminus 0 \to \mathbb P^n\) is the projection.
It suffices to show that \(C^* = \pi^{-1}(X)\) is irreducible.
For every \(x \in X\), set \(L_x = \pi^{-1}(x)\); this is a copy of \(\mathbb A^1 \setminus 0\), and hence irreducible.
Now, if \(C^* = Z_1 \cup Z_2\), then by the argument as in the proof of <a href="#orge5f6c89">7.1.6</a>, we get that \(\pi^{-1}L_x \subset Z_i\) for some \(i\).
As before, define \(W_i \subset X\) as the set of \(x \in X\)  such that \(\pi^{-1}(L_x) \subset Z_i\).
Then \(X = W_1 \cup W_2\).
We claim, as before, that \(W_i \subset X\) is closed.
Then, using the irreducibility of \(X\), we are done.
</p>

<p>
To see that \(W_i \subset X\) is closed, we cannot literally use the same argument as before, because \(C^*\) is not a product \(X \times \mathbb A^1 \setminus 0\).
Nevertheless, it is <i>locally</i> a product: there exists an open cover \(U_j\) of \(X\) such that \(\pi^{-1} U_j \cong U_j \times (\mathbb A^1 \setminus 0)\), where \(\pi \colon C^* \to X\) is the obvious projection map.
Hence, the argument in <a href="#orge5f6c89">7.1.6</a> shows that that \(W_i \cap U_j \subset U_j\) is closed.
And since \(U_j\) is a cover of \(X\), we get that \(W_i \subset X\) is closed.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-8-4-1">
<p>
Let \(X\) be an algebraic variety and \(x \in X\) a point. Then we have
\[ {\rm krdim}_x X = {\rm sldim}_x X.\]
Furthermore, if \(X\) is irreducible, then both are equal to \({\rm trdim} X\).
</p>

<p>
We denote the dimension by \({\rm dim}_x X\).
The theorem says that if \(X\) is irreducible then this number does not depend on \(x\).
If \(X\) is reducible, then it is easy to see (using the Krull dimension) that \({\rm dim}_x X\) is the maximum of the dimensions of the irreducible components of \(X\) that contain \(x\).
A variety is <i>equidimensional</i> if \({\rm dim}_x X\) is the same for all \(x \in X\).
This is the same as saying that all irreducible components of \(X\) have the same dimension.
</p>

<p>
We will not prove this theorem.  Its proper place is a course in commutative algebra.  The famous book &ldquo;Commutative Algebra&rdquo; by Atiyah and MacDonald has an excellent exposition (in the last chapter), where they also give a fourth equivalent definition.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-8-5-1">
<p>
For irreducible \(X\) and \(Y\), we have
\[{\rm dim} (X \times Y) = {\rm dim} X + {\rm dim} Y. \]
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org1dde3cd">
<p>
We first use Krull dimension to get an inequality.
Let \(m = {\rm dim} X\) and let \(x \in X\) be arbitrary.
We have a (strict) chain of irreducible closed subsets
\[ \{x\} \subset X_1 \subset \dots \subset X_m = X,\]
yielding a chain of irreducible closed subsets
\[ \{x\} \times Y \subset X_1 \times Y \dots \subset X_m \times Y = X \times Y.\]
Let \(n = {\rm dim} Y\) and let \(y \in Y\) be arbitrary.
Then we have a (strict) chain of irreducible closed subsets
\[ \{y\} \subset Y_1 \subset \dots \subset Y_n = Y.\]
If we take the product with \(\{x\}\) and append it to the chain above, we get a (strict) chain 
\[ \{(x,y)\} \subset \{x\} \times Y_1 \dots \subset \{x\} \times Y_n \subset X_1 \times Y \subset \dots \subset X_m \times Y.\]
As a result, we have
\[{\rm krdim}(X \times Y) \geq m+n.\]
(We don&rsquo;t get equality because we haven&rsquo;t proved that there cannot be a longer chain).
</p>

<p>
For the opposite inequality, we use slicing dimension.
There exist \(m\) regular functions in a neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\) on \(X\) whose zero locus is \(x\).
There exist \(n\) regular functions in a neighborhood \(V\) of \(y\) on \(Y\) whose zero locus is \(y\).
In \(U \times V\), the \(m+n\) functions together have zero locus \((x,y)\).
As a result, we have
\[ {\rm sldim} (X \times Y) \leq m + n.\]
(We don&rsquo;t get equality because we haven&rsquo;t proved that a smaller set of functions does not suffice.)
</p>

<p>
But since \({\rm sldim} = {\rm krdim}\), we have proved what we wanted.

<p>
<a id="org3b64909"></a>
Let \(U \subset \mathbb P^n\) be an open subset and \(\phi \colon U \to \mathbb P^m\) a regular function.
Then there exist homogeneous functions \(F_0, \dots, F_m \in k[X_0, \dots, X_n]\) of the same degree such that they have no common zero on \(U\) and for every \(u \in U\), we have
\[ \phi(u) = [F_0(u): \dots :F_m(u)]\]
</p>

<div class="proof" id="orgf2a47c1">
<p>
A conceptual proof of this fact uses the classification of line bundles on \(\mathbb P^n\).  Here is more elementary (but clumsy) proof.
</p>

<p>
Pick some \(u \in U\).
We first show that \(\phi\) has the required form in <i>some</i> open subset containing \(u\).
Without loss of generality, assume that \(u\) and \(\phi(u)\) lie in the charts of the projective spaces here the 0-th coordinate is non-zero.
Then \(u = [1: u_1 :\dots: u_n]\) and \(\phi(u) = [1:v_1:\dots:v_m]\).
By defintion of a regular map, there exist rational functions \(g_i(x_1,\dots,x_n)\) for \(i = 1,\dots, m\) such that
\[ \phi([1:x_1:\dots:x_n]) = [1:g_1(x_1,\dots,x_n): \dots: g_m(x_1,\dots,x_n)]\]
for all \(x = [1:x_1:\dots:x_n]\) in some open subset of \(U\) containing \(u\).
Multiply this expression for \(\phi\) by a large enough polynomial so that
\[ \phi([1:x_1:\dots:x_n]) = [f_0(x_1,\dots,x_n): \dots: f_m(x_1,\dots,x_n)],\]
here the \(f_i\) are polynomials.
Choose \(d \geq \deg f_i\) for all \(i\).
Homogenise the \(f_i\) with respect to \(x_0\) to make them homogeneous of degree \(d\).
That is, set \(F_i(x_0, \dots, x_n) = x_0^d f(x_1/x_0, \dots, x_n/x_0).\)
Then \(\phi\) has the form
\[ \phi([x_0, \dots, x_n]) = [F_0(x_0,\dots,x_n):\dots:F_m(x_0,\dots,x_n)]\]
for all \(x = [x_0:\dots:x_n]\) in some open set containing \(u\).
We may assume that the \(F_i\) do not share a common factor (if they do, cancel it out).
</p>

<p>
We now show that the \(F_i\) cannot have a common zero on \(U\), and therefore, the expression \(\phi = [F_i]\) holds on all of \(U\).
Suppose \(x \in U\) is such that all \(F_i\) vanish at \(x\).
We show that then the \(F_i\) share a common factor.
By the argument before, there must be an alternate expression \(\phi = [G_i]\) in a neighborhood of \(x\) in which some \(G_i(x)\) is non-zero. 
Suppose \(G_0(x) \neq 0\).
Since we have \([F_i] = [G_i]\) on the open set where both are defined, we have \(F_i G_j = G_i F_j\).
In particular, we have \(F_0 G_j = G_0 F_j\).
Let \(P\) be a prime factor of \(F_0\) such that \(P(x) = 0\) (all factors of homogeneous polynomials are homogeneous).
Then \(P\) divides \(F_0F_j\), but \(P\) cannot divide \(G_0\), as \(G_0(x) \neq 0\).
So \(P\) divides \(F_j\).
Since this is true for all \(j\), we get a common factor \(P\) in all \(F_i\).

Let \(f \colon X \to Y\) be a dominant map between irreducible varieties. Then for every \(x \in X\) with \(y = f(x)\), we have
\[ {\rm dim}_x f^{-1}(y) \geq {\rm dim} X - {\rm dim} Y.\]
Furthermore, there exists a non-empty open \(U \subset Y\) such that for every \(y \in Y\), the fiber \(f^{-1}(y)\) is non-empty and equidimensional of dimension \({\rm dim} X - {\rm dim} Y\).

<p>
That is, for almost all \(y \in Y\), the dimension of the fiber is the difference in the dimensions, as expected.  But there may be some points in \(Y\) whose fiber has a different dimension.  But in this case, the dimension can only be bigger, not smaller.
