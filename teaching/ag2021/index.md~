This year, the course will be on algebraic geometry, the study of algebraic equations using geometry and geometric shapes using algebra.
We will begin with affine varieties&#x2014;solution sets of polynomial equations&#x2014;and use these as building blocks to construct a rich world of geometric objects that include Riemann surfaces, projective spaces, and Grassmannians.

# Pre-requisites

Algebra 1 and Algebra 2.

Algebraic geometry interacts deeply with many other areas of mathematics, so some background in topology, complex analysis, and differential geometry will be helpful, but not required.

# Assessment

The final mark is based on three factors.

1.  (50%) 10 homework sets
2.  (25%) A mid-semester exam (take-home, in-person, or Zoom)
3.  (25%) A final exam (take-home, in-person, or Zoom)

If you are a masters student or taking the course as an ASC/ASE, your assessment will include an additional project component.

# Policies


<a id="orgc9a8821"></a>

## Late submission

I will not accept any late submissions, except for medical emergencies with a medical certificate.
To compensate for this strict policy, I will drop the lowest homework mark. So, you will have the opportunity to complete 11 homework sets, and the 10 highest will count towards the final mark.


<a id="orgaa1b0bb"></a>

## Collaboration

You are allowed, even encouraged, to work with others on homework assignments, but you must write up your solutions **on your own**. In other words, you **may not** copy someone else's write-up and you **may not** write your solutions side by side someone else. On your submission, you must write the names of your collaborators. This is a matter of academic honesty; it will not affect your marks. 

There will be no collaboration on the exams.
