title: 'Advanced topics in algebra: Algebraic geometry'
no-navigation: true
---

This year, the course will be on algebraic geometry, the study of algebraic equations using geometry and geometric shapes using algebra.
We will begin with affine varieties&#x2014;solution sets of polynomial equations&#x2014;and use these as building blocks to construct a rich world of geometric objects that include Riemann surfaces, projective spaces, Grassmannians, etc.

# Pre-requisites

Algebra 1 and Algebra 2.

Algebraic geometry interacts deeply with many other areas of mathematics, so some background in topology, complex analysis, and differential geometry will be helpful, but not required. 


# Assessment

The final mark is based on three factors.

1.  (50%) Homework + classwork
2.  (25%) A mid-semester exam (take-home, in-person, or Zoom)
3.  (25%) A final exam (take-home, in-person, or Zoom)

The classwork will consist of progress reports and the associated write-up, each equivalent to 1 homework set.
If you are a masters student or taking the course as an ASC/ASE, your assessment will include an additional project component.


## Classwork

The format of our classwork will be as follows. The first meeting of the week (Monday) will be a traditional lecture in which I will explain the key ideas of a topic, but not prove all the details. In the following two meetings (Wednesday, Thursday), we will work out the details in small groups. By the end of Thursday, you will write a &ldquo;progress report&rdquo; (a 1-2 sentence summary of your progress for each question) and submit it on Gradescope. On Friday, based on the progress reports, I will present the solutions. Students (selected at random) will write up the solutions and send them to me in a week. I will add the write-ups to [our notes](notes). 


# Policies


## Late submission

I will not accept any late submissions, except for medical emergencies with a medical certificate.
To compensate for this strict policy, I will drop the lowest among the (homework+classwork) marks.


## Collaboration

You are allowed, even encouraged, to work with others on homework assignments, but you must write up your solutions **on your own**. In other words, you **may not** copy someone else&rsquo;s write-up and you **may not** write your solutions side by side with someone else. On your submission, you must write the names of your collaborators. This is a matter of academic honesty; it will not affect your marks. 

There will be no collaboration on the exams.
