This year, the course will be on algebraic geometry, the study of algebraic equations using geometry and geometric shapes using algebra.
We will begin with affine varieties&#x2014;solution sets of polynomial equations&#x2014;and use these as building blocks to construct a rich world of geometric objects that include Riemann surfaces, projective spaces, Grassmannians, etc.

# Pre-requisites

Algebra 1 and Algebra 2.

Algebraic geometry interacts deeply with many other areas of mathematics, so some background in topology, complex analysis, and differential geometry will be helpful, but not required. 


# Assessment

The final mark is based on three factors.

1.  (50%) Homework + classwork
2.  (25%) A mid-semester exam (take-home, in-person, or Zoom)
3.  (25%) A final exam (take-home, in-person, or Zoom)

The classwork will consist of presentations and the associated write-up, each equivalent to 1 homework set.

If you are a masters student or taking the course as an ASC/ASE, your assessment will include an additional project component.


# Policies


## Late submission

I will not accept any late submissions, except for medical emergencies with a medical certificate.
To compensate for this strict policy, I will drop the lowest homework/classwork mark.


## Collaboration

You are allowed, even encouraged, to work with others on homework assignments, but you must write up your solutions **on your own**. In other words, you **may not** copy someone else's write-up and you **may not** write your solutions side by side with someone else. On your submission, you must write the names of your collaborators. This is a matter of academic honesty; it will not affect your marks. 

There will be no collaboration on the exams.
