Welcome to Algebra 3!

This year, algebra 3 will be algebraic geometry.

We will study the geometry of subsets of the affine or projective space defined by the vanishing of polynomial equations, or in other words, (quasi)-projective varieties.

## Prerequisites

Algebra 1 and algebra 2.
Some knowledge of commutative algebra will help, but is not required.

## References

We will follow *Basic Algebraic Geometry, Part I* by Igor Shafarevich and the [online notes](https://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~gathmann/class/alggeom-2002/alggeom-2002.pdf) by Andreas Gathmann. 

## Outline


Here is a preliminary outline of the course, which will undoubtedly change in time.

* Week 1: What is algebraic geometry?, 
  Affine space, closed (algebraic) subsets of affine space. 
  Ideals, Hilbert's basis theorem, Zariski topology.
  Examples and non-examples.
  (Gathmann Chapter 0, Shafarevich Section 1.2.1)
      
* Week 2:
  The ring of regular functions.
  The ideal associated to a subset of affine space.
  The nullstellensatz and consequences.
  (Shafarevich 1.2.2, Shafarevich A.9, Gathmann 1.2)

* Week 3:
  Regular maps between affine algebraic sets, isomorphisms.
   Category of affine algebraic sets = Category of nilpotent-free, finitely generated algebras.
   (Shafarevich 1.2.3 )

* Week 4:

   (Shafarevich 1.4.2, 1.4.3)

* Week 8:
   Projections.
   Veronese and Segre embedding.
   (Shafarevich 1.4.4, 1.5.1)

* Week 9:
   The closed image property.
