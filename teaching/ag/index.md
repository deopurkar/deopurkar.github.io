---

Welcome to Algebra 3!
This year, algebra 3 will be algebraic geometry.

## Prerequisites

Algebra 1 and algebra 2.
Some knowledge of commutative algebra will help, but is not required.

## References

We will follow *Basic Algebraic Geometry, Part I* by Igor Shafarevich and the [online notes](https://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~gathmannn/class/alggeom-2002/alggeom-2002.pdf) by Andreas Gathmann. 

## Outline

We will study the geometry of quasi-projective varieties over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0.
Here is a preliminary outline of the course, which will undoubtedly change in time.

* Week 1: What is algebraic geometry?, 
  Affine space, closed (algebraic) subsets of affine space. 
  Ideals, Hilbert's basis theorem, Zariski topology.
  Examples and non-examples.
  (Gathmann Chapter 0, Shafarevich Section 1.2.1)
      
* Week 2:
  The ring of regular functions.
  The ideal associated to a subset of affine space.
  The nullstellensatz and consequences.
  (Shafarevich 1.2.2, Shafarevich A.9, Gathmann 1.2)

* Week 3:
  Regular maps between affine algebraic sets, isomorphisms.
   Category of affine algebraic sets = Category of nilpotent-free, finitely generated algebras.
   (Shafarevich 1.2.3 )

* Week 4:
   Irreducibility, irreducible components.
   Rational functions, domain of definition.
   (Shafarevich 1.3.1, 1.3.2, Gathmann 1.3)

* Week 5:
   Rational maps, birational maps.
   (Shafarevich 1.3.2, 1.3.3)

* Week 6:
   Projective space, projective varieties.
   Quasi-projective variety.
   (Shafarevich 1.4.1)

* Week 7:
   Regular functions, regular maps, rational maps on quasi-projective varieties.
   (Shafarevich 1.4.2, 1.4.3)

* Week 8:
   Projections.
   Veronese and Segre embedding.
   (Shafarevich 1.4.4, 1.5.1)

* Week 9:
   The closed image property.
   Finite maps, Noether normalization.
   (Shafarevich 1.5.2, 1.5.3, 1.5.4)

* Week 10:
   Dimension theory

* Week 11:
   Local ring at a point.
   Tangent spaces, singularities.

* Week 12:
   ???
