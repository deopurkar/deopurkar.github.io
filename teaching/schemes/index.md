**This is in flux and subject to change.**


# Introduction

We will learn the modern foundations of algebraic geometry: sheaves, schemes, and cohomology.
Our primary reference will be [Ravi Vakil's book-in-progress](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGnov1817public.pdf), possibly supplemented by other sources.
Luckily, Ravi also has online lectures for this course, which we will watch.

I will assign weekly reading and viewing.
We will discuss the material by meeting (remotely) twice a week for 1 to 1.5 hours.


## Assignments

You will take turns to nicely write-up a detailed account of every week's discussion (I will upload these to the website).
In addition, there will be a few written assignments.
There will be an oral midterm and an oral final exam.
Your mark will be based on your write-ups, assignments, and exams.
