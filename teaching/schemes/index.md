# Introduction

We will learn the modern foundations of algebraic geometry: sheaves, schemes, and cohomology from [Ravi Vakil's book-in-progress](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGnov1817public.pdf), online lecture videos, and weekly discussions.

We will hang out at [**schemes2020 on zulip**](https://schemes2020.zulipchat.com).


## Prerequisites

A solid foundation in topology and algebra (rings, fields, modules), and familiarity with some algebraic geometry or commutative algebra and the language of categories.
This means HD in Analysis 1, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, and either Algebra 3 or a Special Topics Course about algebraic geometry (Martin/Markus) or commutative algebra (Amnon).
**If you are taking this course for a grade, you must have these pre-requisites or my explicit permission.** But in the open spirit of Ravi's project, if you want to participate (audit) this course, you are welcome! 


## Assessement

1.  5 written assignments (50%)
2.  Two oral exams (50%)


## Written assignments

1.  (Due 14 Aug): 1.3.E, 1.4.E, 2.3.A, 2.3.I, 2.3.J, 2.4.E, 2.4.N, 2.4.O.
2.  (Due 04 Sep)
3.  (Due 25 Sep)
4.  (Due 09 Oct)
5.  (Due 30 Oct)


# Weekly reading, viewing, and doing

"Do" does not mean "write up and submit". 
A general convention in Ravi's book is that â‹† indicates an advanced section that can be skipped on the first reading.


## Week 1

-   Read: [Chapter 1 Sections 1.1&#x2013;1.3.4 (localisation)](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGnov1817public.pdf).
-   Watch: [AGITOC Pseudo-lecture 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTEZjR5aNjw).
-   Do: 1.2.B, 1.3.A, 1.3.D,  1.3.E, 1.3.G, and ponder:
    1.  "A group is a category with 1 object and invertible morphisms." Love it or hate it?
    2.  Learn the language of universal properties and use it to phrase the constructions you already know. For example: kernels, cokernels, finite/infinite sums and products.
    3.  You may not have seen localisation before. That's OK. Try to digest as much as you can.
    4.  Show (preferably using the universal property) that the localisation $R\_f$ is isomorphic to $R[y]/(yf-1)$.
    5.  What is the geometric meaning of localisation? Can you use it to construct an example where $R \\neq 0$ but $R\_f = 0$?


## Week 2

-   Read: [Chapter 1 Section 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGnov1817public.pdf)
-   Skim: [Chapter 1 Section 1.3.6, 1.3.7, 1.5, 1.6](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGnov1817public.pdf)
-   Watch: [AGITOC Pseudo-lecture 2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqt1f8owKrU)
-   Do:
    1.  1.4.B (limits in `Sets`)
    2.  1.4.C ($\\mathbb Q$ as a colimit)
    3.  1.4.F (localisation as a colimit)
    4.  2.1.A (stalk is a local ring)
    5.  2.2.D (sheaves of functions)
    6.  2.2.E (constant sheaves)
    7.  2.2.F (morphisms form a sheaf)
    8.  2.3.C (sheaf hom)
    9.  2.3.I (kernel of sheaf maps is a sheaf)
    10. 2.3.J (but the cokernel may not be a sheaf)


## Week 3

-   Read: Two independent tracks
    -   (Sheaves continued): 2.4, 2.5, 2.6
    -   (Affine schemes): 3.1, 3.2 (up to 3.2.E, and especially Examples 1&#x2013;8).
-   Watch: [AGITTOC Pseudo-lecture 3](https://youtu.be/0lZFVGsYxj8)
-   Think:
    Come to terms with the new way of defining spaces from local models. The old mantra was "set + topology + local models + gluing maps". Now sheaves do the gluing for us, so the new mantra is "set + topology + sheaf of rings + local models".
