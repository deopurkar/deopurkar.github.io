# Introduction

We will learn the modern foundations of algebraic geometry: sheaves, schemes, and cohomology from [Ravi Vakil's book-in-progress](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGnov1817public.pdf), online lecture videos, and weekly discussions.

We will hang out at [**schemes2020 on zulip**](https://schemes2020.zulipchat.com).


## Prerequisites

A solid foundation in topology and algebra (rings, fields, modules), and familiarity with some algebraic geometry or commutative algebra and the language of categories.
This means HD in Analysis 1, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, and either Algebra 3 or a Special Topics Course about algebraic geometry (Martin/Markus) or commutative algebra (Amnon).
**If you are taking this course for a grade, you must have these pre-requisites or my explicit permission.** But in the open spirit of Ravi's project, if you want to participate (audit) this course, you are welcome! 


## Assessement

1.  4 written assignments (40%)
2.  One or two written accounts of our weekly discussions (10%)
3.  Two oral exams (50%)


# Weekly reading, viewing, and doing

"Do" does not mean "write up and submit". 
A general convention in Ravi's book is that â‹† indicates an advanced section that can be skipped on the first reading.


## Week 1

-   Read: [Chapter 1 Sections 1.1&#x2013;1.3.4 (localisation)](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGnov1817public.pdf).
-   Watch: [AGITOC Pseudo-lecture 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTEZjR5aNjw).
-   Do: 1.2.B, 1.3.A, 1.3.D,  1.3.E, 1.3.G, and ponder:
    1.  "A group is a category with 1 object and invertible morphisms." Love it or hate it?
    2.  Learn the language of universal properties and use it to phrase the constructions you already know. For example: kernels, cokernels, finite/infinite sums and products.
    3.  You may not have seen localisation before. That's OK. Try to digest as much as you can.
    4.  Show (preferably using the universal property) that the localisation $R\_f$ is isomorphic to $R[y]/(yf-1)$.
    5.  What is the geometric meaning of localisation? Can you use it to construct an example where $R \\neq 0$ but $R\_f = 0$?


## Week 2

-   Read: [Chapter 1 Section 1.3.6 (skim), 1.4, 2.1, 2.2](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGnov1817public.pdf)
-   Watch/skim: [AGITOC Pseudo-lecture 2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqt1f8owKrU)
-   Do:
    1.  1.4.B (limits in `Sets`)
    2.  1.4.C ($\\mathbb Q$ as a colimit)
    3.  1.4.F (localisation as a colimit)
    4.  2.1.A (stalk is a local ring)
    5.  2.2.D (sheaves of functions)
    6.  2.2.E (constant sheaves)
    7.  2.2.F (morphisms form a sheaf)
