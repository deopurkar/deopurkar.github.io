    Do you want to count how many times a cubic surface appears in any reasonable family? [Anand Patel](https://sites.google.com/view/anand-patel), [Dennis Tseng](https://sites.google.com/view/dennis-tseng), and I prove a formula that will give the answer.  For example, in a general 4-dimensional linear series of cubic surfaces in projective 3 space, a given cubic, up to isomorphism, appears 96120 times!

- what: |
    With [Asilata Bapat](https://asilata.github.io/) and [Tony Licata](https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~licatat/Home.html), I am thinking about various aspects of stability conditions on some triangulated categories. We finished a [draft of a proposed construction of a compactification of this space](/research/papers/a2-compactification.pdf) with full details for the A<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>1</sub>-hat cases. The [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07908) is now on the arXiv.

- what: |
    We give constructive proofs of some results about the stability space and spherical objects in the ADE-quiver categories. Some of the statements may be known to the experts. Here is a [draft](papers/algorithm.pdf).

- what: |
    I am teaching an advanced undergraduate course on algebraic geometry in the first half of 2021, similar to [a class I taught in 2019](/teaching/ag).

- what: |
    I gave a talk about the project with Asilata and Tony at AustMS 2020 (online) on December 9 in the topology session ([slides](/talks/AustMS2020slides.pdf)).and a longer version at Jagiellonian University (Poland) and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (India) ([slides](/talks/tifr2021slides.pdf))

- what: |
      [Anand Patel](https://sites.google.com/view/anand-patel/home), [Eduard Duryev](https://eduryev.weebly.com/), and I finished a paper about some [fascinating variational and enumerative questions arising from a simple construction related to linear projections](/research/papers/PR.pdf). Answers to some of these enumerative questions fit the [sequence A001181 on OEIS](https://oeis.org/A001181), but we are stumped as to why!
