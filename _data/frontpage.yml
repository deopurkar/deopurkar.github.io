- what: |
    With [Asilata Bapat](https://asilata.github.io/) and [Tony Licata](https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~licatat/Home.html), I am thinking about various aspects of stability conditions on some triangulated categories. We finished a [draft of a proposed construction of a compactification of this space](/research/papers/a2-compactification.pdf) with full details for the A<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>1</sub>-hat cases. The [Farey sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence) makes an appearance!

- what: |
    [Anand Patel](https://sites.google.com/view/anand-patel/home), [Eduard Duryev](https://eduryev.weebly.com/), and I finished a paper about some [fascinating variational and enumerative questions arising from a simple construction related to linear projections](/research/papers/PR.pdf). Answers to some of these enumerative questions fit the [sequence A001181 on OEIS](https://oeis.org/A001181), but we are stumped as to why!

- what: |
    In Semester 2 of 2020, I am running a special topics course [Foundations of algebraic geometry](/teaching/schemes).
