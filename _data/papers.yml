  coauthors: ["[Asilata Bapat](https://asilata.github.io/)", "[Anthony Licata](https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~licatat/)"]
  abstract:  "We define a map from the space of Bridgeland stability conditions on a triangulated category C to an infinite projective space.  We conjecture that under some mild assumptions on the triangulated category C this map to be a homeomorphism onto its image and that the closure is a real manifold with boundary.   Thus we obtain a compactification of the space of stability conditions.  Both the definition and expected properties of this compactification are analogous in many respects to Thurston's compactification of the Teichmuller space of a hyperbolic surface. In this paper we study in detail the case when C is the 2-Calabi-Yau category associated to the $A_2$ quiver, and prove our conjectures in that case."

- title: Anticanonical tropical cubic del Pezzos contain exactly 27 lines
  coauthors: ["[María Angélica Cueto](https://people.math.osu.edu/cueto.5/)"]
  abstract: "The classical statement of Cayley-Salmon that there are 27 lines on every smooth cubic surface in P^3 fails to hold under tropicalization: a tropical cubic surface in TP^3 often contains infinitely many tropical lines. Under mild genericity assumptions, we show that when embedded using the Eckardt triangles in the anticanonical system, tropical cubic del Pezzo surfaces contain exactly 27 tropical lines. In the non-generic case, which we identify explicitly, we find up to 27 extra lines, no multiple of which lifts to a curve on the cubic surface. 
We realize the moduli space of stable anticanonical tropical cubics as a four-dimensional fan in R^40 with an action of the Weyl group W(E_6). In the absence of Eckardt points, we show the combinatorial types of these tropical surfaces are determined by the boundary arrangement of 27 metric trees corresponding to the tropicalization of the classical 27 lines on the smooth algebraic cubic surfaces. Tropical convexity and the combinatorics of the root system E_6 play a central role in our analysis."

- title: Ramification divisors of general projections
  coauthors: ["[Eduard Duryev](https://eduryev.weebly.com/)", "[Anand Patel](https://www2.bc.edu/anand-p-patel/)"]
  abstract:   We study the ramification divisors of projections of a smooth projective variety onto a linear subspace of the same dimension. We prove that the ramification divisors vary in a maximal dimensional family for a large class of varieties. Going further, we study the map that associates to a linear projection its ramification divisor. We show that this map is dominant for most (but not all!) varieties of minimal degree, using (linked) limit linear series of higher rank. We find the degree of this map in some cases, extending the classical appearance of Catalan numbers in the geometry of rational normal curves, and give a geometric explanation of its fibers in terms of torsion points of naturally occurring elliptic curves in the case of the Veronese surface and the quartic rational surface scroll.

  abstract: We describe a compactification of the moduli space of pairs (S,C) where S is a smooth quadric surface in 3-space and C is a smooth divisor on S of class (3,3). We show that the compactified moduli space is a smooth Deligne-Mumford stack with 4 boundary components. We relate our compactification with compactifications of the moduli space of genus 4 curves. In particular, we show that our space compactifies the blow-up of the hyperelliptic locus. We also relate our compactification to a compactification of the Hurwitz space of triple coverings of the projective line by genus 4 curves.

  abstract:   Motivated by the problem of finding algebraic constructions of finite coverings in commutative algebra, the Steinitz realization problem in number theory, and the study of Hurwitz spaces in algebraic geometry, we investigate the vector bundles underlying the structure sheaf of a finite flat branched covering. We prove that, up to a twist, every vector bundle on a smooth projective curve arises from the direct image of the structure sheaf of a smooth, connected branched cover.

These divisors arise from vector bundles of syzygies canonically associated to a branched cover. We find that the cycle classes are all proportional to each other.

Using our construction, we compactify the space of tetragonal curves on Hirzebruch surfaces. As an application, we explicitly describe the boundary divisors of the closure in $\overline{M}_6$ of the locus of smooth plane quintic curves.

  abstract: We establish sharp bounds for the slopes of curves in $\overline{M}_g$ that sweep the locus of trigonal curves, proving Stankova-Frenkel\'s conjectured bound of 7+6/g for even g and obtaining the bound 7+20/(3g+1) for odd g. For even g, we find an explicit expression of the so-called Maroni divisor in the Picard group of the space of admissible triple covers. For odd g, we describe the analogous extremal effective divisor and give a similar explicit expression.

  abstract: We construct a sequence of modular compactifications of the space of marked trigonal curves by allowing the branch points to coincide to a given extent. Beginning with the standard admissible cover compactification, the sequence first proceeds through contractions of the boundary divisors and then through flips of the so-called Maroni strata, culminating in a Fano model for even genera and a Fano fibration for odd genera. While the sequence of divisorial contractions arises from a more general construction, the sequence of flips uses the particular geometry of triple covers. We explicitly describe the Mori chamber decomposition given by this sequence of flips.

  abstract: We construct several modular compactifications of the Hurwitz space H^d_{g/h} of genus g curves expressed as d-sheeted, simply branched covers of genus h curves. These compactifications are obtained by allowing the branch points of the covers to collide to a variable extent. They are very well-behaved if d=2,3, or if relatively few collisions are allowed. We recover as special cases the spaces of twisted admissible covers of Abramovich, Corti and Vistoli and the spaces of hyperelliptic curves of Fedorchuk.
