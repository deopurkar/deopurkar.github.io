  abstract: We describe a sequence of effective divisors on the Hurwitz space H(d,g) for d dividing g-1 and compute their cycle classes on a partial compactification. These divisors arise from vector bundles of syzygies canonically associated to a branched cover. We find that the cycle classes are all proportional to each other.

    arXiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07755/
  abstract: We prove the analogue for ribbons of Green\'s canonical syzygy conjecture, formulated by Bayer and Eisenbud. Our proof uses the results of Voisin and Hirschowitz-Ramanan on Green\'s conjecture for general smooth curves.
