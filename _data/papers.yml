  abstract: We describe a sequence of effective divisors on the Hurwitz space H(d,g) for d dividing g-1 and compute their cycle classes on a partial compactification. These divisors arise from vector bundles of syzygies canonically associated to a branched cover. We find that the cycle classes are all proportional to each other.

  abstract: We prove the analogue for ribbons of Green\'s canonical syzygy conjecture, formulated by Bayer and Eisenbud. Our proof uses the results of Voisin and Hirschowitz-Ramanan on Green\'s conjecture for general smooth curves.

    arXiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03252/
  abstract: 	  We construct a well-behaved compactification of the space of finite covers of a stacky curve using admissible cover degenerations. Using our construction, we compactify the space of tetragonal curves on Hirzebruch surfaces. As an application, we explicitly describe the boundary divisors of the closure in \overline{M}_6 of the locus of smooth plane quintic curves.

  abstract: We use Groebner basis techniques to study the balanced canonical ribbon in each odd genus g \geq 5. We obtain equations and syzygies of the ribbon, give a Groebner interpretation of part of Alper, Fedorchuk, and Smyth\'s proof of finite Hilbert stability for canonical curves, and discuss the obstacles in using ribbons to give a new proof of Generic Green\'s Conjecture (Voisin\'s Theorem).

  abstract: We establish sharp bounds for the slopes of curves in \overline{M}_g that sweep the locus of trigonal curves, proving Stankova-Frenkel\'s conjectured bound of 7+6/g for even g and obtaining the bound 7+20/(3g+1) for odd g. For even g, we find an explicit expression of the so-called Maroni divisor in the Picard group of the space of admissible triple covers. For odd g, we describe the analogous extremal effective divisor and give a similar explicit expression.

  abstract: We construct a sequence of modular compactifications of the space of marked trigonal curves by allowing the branch points to coincide to a given extent. Beginning with the standard admissible cover compactification, the sequence first proceeds through contractions of the boundary divisors and then through flips of the so-called Maroni strata, culminating in a Fano model for even genera and a Fano fibration for odd genera. While the sequence of divisorial contractions arises from a more general construction, the sequence of flips uses the particular geometry of triple covers. We explicitly describe the Mori chamber decomposition given by this sequence of flips.

  abstract: We construct several modular compactifications of the Hurwitz space H^d_{g/h} of genus g curves expressed as d-sheeted, simply branched covers of genus h curves. These compactifications are obtained by allowing the branch points of the covers to collide to a variable extent. They are very well-behaved if d=2,3, or if relatively few collisions are allowed. We recover as special cases the spaces of twisted admissible covers of Abramovich, Corti and Vistoli and the spaces of hyperelliptic curves of Fedorchuk.
