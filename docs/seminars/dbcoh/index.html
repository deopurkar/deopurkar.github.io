We organised our reading and wrote comments on an anonymous collaborative whiteboard (<a href="https://www.mathdown.net/?doc=I7X3CpuNsKa#DbCoh">https://www.mathdown.net/?doc=I7X3CpuNsKa#DbCoh</a>).
We used a Google Jamboard and zoom when we met in person (and zoom).

<li>In Remark 10.8ii, it is mentioned that the corresponding fact for abelian varieties is deeper. What part of the argument of Cor 10.7 breaks down for abelian varieties? Is it integrality of Mukai vectors?</li>

<li>It&rsquo;s a bit odd that 10.3 says nothing about why M is a K3.
(It&rsquo;s derived equivalent to a K3, hence a K3.)</li>

<li>In the proof of 10.10, why does \(\phi\) induce an isometry on \(H^2\) if \(\phi(0,0,1) = \pm(0,0,1)\)?</li>

<li>Proposition 10.24 seems to say, in particular, that every (?) (-2) Mukai vector is the class of a spherical sheaf.</li>

<li>The proof of Lemma 10.6 went a bit quickly for me so it would be nice to talk briefly about it.</li>

<li>I found the first part of Section 10.3 to be a very readable explanation of coarse and fine moduli spaces. But I got lost in the second part, so I would like to have a discussion about it.</li>

<li>Proof of 9.19: the paragraph at the top of page 202 is superfluous.</li>

<li>9.20: as stated the closed point \(a\in A\) plays no role. Of course one can reverse the roles of \(A\) and \(\hat A\), tenroing with line bundles on \(\hat A\) and translating by points in \(A\).</li>

<li>9.26: Doesn&rsquo;t seem correct. The commutative square giving the fact that \(f:B\to A\) is a homomorphism isn&rsquo;t cartesian, hence there is no reason to expect that the base-change map \(f^*m_*(\cal{F}\boxtimes\cal{E})\to m_*(f^*\cal{F}\boxtimes f^*\cal{E})\) should be an isomorphism.
I think it even fails for skypscraper sheaves.</li>

<li><p>
Proof of 9.30: the only place where 9.26 is used is in this proof, more specidically in the sequence on equation in the middle of page 208. In this application \(f=\varphi_L^{}\) is an isomorphism, in which case there is no problem. The square in 3. is cartesian.
</p>

<p>
Also in the proof of 9.30, I was confused for a long time about the proof of commutativity of the square on page 208, but then realised that for an isomorphism, the push-forward is the same as the pull-back by the inverse.

<li>I find the following form of 8.28 easier to understand: Every \(F \in D^b(X)\) has a filtration \[ 0 = F_0 \to F_1 \to \cdots \to F_n = F\] whose &ldquo;subquotients&rdquo; are \(R\pi_*(F(r)) \otimes \Omega^{-r}(-r)\).

<li>8.30: there&rsquo;s definitely something wrong in the statement, after all the exact sequence \(0\to\Omega(1)\to\cal{O}^{n+1}\to\cal{O}(1)\to0\) gives lots of nonzero maps \(\Omega(1)\to\cal{O}\).

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Here is an example of Example 8.17: Let \(X\) be a K3 surface. Then \(Y = {\rm Hilb}^n X\) (the Hilbert scheme of \(n\) points on \(X\)) is an algebraic symplectic variety of dimension \(2n\). Suppose we have a \((-2)\) curve \(C \subset X\). Then we have a \(\mathbb P^n \cong  {\rm Hilb^n} C \subset Y\). On \(X\), we have a spherical twist \(D^b(X) \to D^b(X)\) given by \(\mathcal O_C\). On \(Y\), we have a $\mathbb P<sup>n</sup>$-twist \(D^b(Y) \to D^b(Y)\) given by \(\mathcal O_{{\rm Hilb}^n C}\).
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In general, how you obtain this \((-2)\) curve C? 
In general, there is no such (-2) curve. But some special K3 surfaces may have one. For example, if you move your K3 surface in a family and it acquires a suitable singularity (of type ADE), then its minimal resolution will be a K3 surface that has (-2) curves.</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Proof of 8.6: The first isomorphism is because $\mathcal{O}<sub>&Delta;</sub>$defines an equivalence?</li>

<li>Lemma 8.12 and its Corollary 8.13 are both interesting. Can anyone give more insight by illustrating a nice example?</li>

<li>In Remarks 5.25(ii): why are \(\text{CH}(X)\) and \(K(X)\) isomorphic after tensoring with \(\mathbb Q\)?</li>

<li>Can someone explain why the proof of Proposition 6.1 has to go by way of Fourier-Mukai kernels? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be simpler to argue that the canonical ring R(X) can be expressed as the graded ring of natural transformations \(T^n\to T^{n+k}\), where \(T=S[-n]\) with \(S\) the Serre functor?</li>

<li>If we proceed as in the proof of Proposition 6.1 in the book, what is the composition? How do you compose maps \(i_*{\mathcal{O}}_X\to i_*\omega_X^k\) and \(i_*\mathcal{O}_X\to i_*\omega_X^\ell\)?
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You tensor the second factor by an appropriate power of \(\omega\). In other words, apply an appropriate power + shift of the Serre functor. This gives a composition \(i_*\cal{O_X} \to i_*\omega_X^k \to i_*\omega_X^{k+l}\).</li>

<li>The proof of \(\pi_X^* \omega_X = \pi_Y^* \omega_Y\) (without the $r$-exponent) on page 149 is only sketched. It&rsquo;ll be nice to talk about it.</li>

<li>Any updates on Conjecture 6.24?</li>

<li>In Lemma 6.11 and Corollary 6.12 there are some liberties taken. The endomorphism ring is k only if the point is closed, but then the result gets applied to points that decidedly aren&rsquo;t closed.</li>

I don&rsquo;t understand the beginning of the proof of 5.23, specifically &ldquo;Choosing local sections of \(\mathcal P\) shows that there is a morphism \(X \to Y\) inducing \(f\).&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The argument easily shows that, if \(p\) is a closed point of \(X\times Y\) and \(i:p\to X\times Y\) is the close immersion, then \(i^*P\) is either zero or 1 dimemnsional. So the sheaf P is locally generated over \(\mathcal{O}_{X\times Y}\) by one generator. And then by pulling to \(\{x\}\times Y\) one sees that this generates already over \(\mathcal{O}_X\). Flatness over \(X\) proves that, in a neighborhood of \((x,f(x))\), \(P\) is locally free of rank 1 over \(\mathcal{O}_X\subset\mathcal{O}_{X\times Y}\). So locally the picture is \(\mathcal{O}_X\subset\mathcal{O}_{X\times Y}\to\frac{\mathcal{O}_{X\times Y}}{\mathcal{I}}\) with the composite an isomorphism.

</ol></li>

<li>Can Anand explain further on the second point in his email on Monday using an example?  In fact, can you give a more intutive understanding of O(1) and why we can often look at a shift of it O(-n) ? (Hartshorne&rsquo;s definition of twisting sheaf O(1) seems hard to grasp) I can foresee that this ample line bundle is going to come out in discussions frequently, so it would be better to pin it down ealier than later.</li>

<li>Proof of Proposition 4.11. By the time one has proved that \(F(k(x))=k(y)\) [middle of page 97], one could also observe that \(F\) preserves the t-structure. After all \(D^b(X)^{\leq0}\) is the subcategory of all \(A\) such that \(Hom(A,k(x)[m])=0\) for all closed points \(x\) and all \(m<0\). It follows that \(F\) also preserves the heart of the t-structure. And now the fact that \(\omega_Y\) is (anti)-ample is just because there exist epimorphisms from direct sums of \(\omega_Y^k\) to arbitrary coherent sheaves \(S\).</li>

<li>I am already stuck on Exercise 4.4. Help! (Edit: I got unstuck.)</li>

<li>Remark 4.7: Is there a characterisation of point-like objects if the canonical bundle is neither ample nor anti-ample? I ask this question even though Huybrechts asks us later to forget about point-like objects beyond this proof, because the remark is tantalising.</li>

<li>Last Friday, Anand talked about Cezh complex. Can someone explain what the the forgetting index do in the coboundary map to make it a chain map?</li>

<li>Why the skyscraper sheaf/residue field k(x) tensor with the canonical bundle/dualizing sheaf w<sub>X</sub> (this is the canonical n-th differential form line bundle?) is isomorphic to k(x)? Side question: skyscraper sheaf k(x) defined on an open set or just a point x.</li>

<li>For lemma 4.5, I can&rsquo;t see where the zero hom condition on negative shifts being used.</li>

<li>A structure sheaf is a kind of line bundle?</li>

<li>I don&rsquo;t understand the last part of the proof of Proposition 4.6 (which aims to show that the cohomology sheaves are supported in dimension 0.)  In particular, I would like to understand why any point-like object in D<sup>b</sup>(X) is of codimension dim(X), as asserted in Remark 4.7</li>

Caution about page 75, line 7: If F and E are quasicoherent then the sheaf Hom(F,E) isn&rsquo;t in general quasicoherent. One needs F to be coherent for this to be true. 
On page 76, the \(R\mathcal Hom\) should go from \(D^-(Coh X)^{\rm op} \times D^+(QCoh X) \to D^+(QCoh X)\). In general, all the \(D^-(Qcoh)\) in this section should be replaced by \(D^-(Coh)\) whenever \(R\mathcal Hom\) appears.
</p>

<p>
(i) Can one explain the reason of replacing Qcoh by Coh with some easy examples? These higher functor properties seems hard to digest without examples in mind.

<li>Page 83, the proof of Lemma 3.31: I don&rsquo;t see why &ldquo;Of course, it suffices to show this for \(\mathfrak{a}=\mathfrak{m}\).&rdquo; And the case \(\mathfrak{a}=\mathfrak{m}\) should be handled more elegantly, just tensor the exact sequence \(0\rightarrow \mathfrak{m}\rightarrow A\rightarrow A/\mathfrak{m}\rightarrow 0\) with the module \(M\). Anyway: it&rsquo;s better to just appeal to the local criterion of flatness.</li>

<li>Proof of 3.17 could be more direct. With the choice of m, we have a map \(F^\bullet \to \mathcal H^m[m]\) compose it with a nonzero map \(\mathcal H^m[m] \to k(x)[m]\).</li>

<li>Is formula (3.18) true (page 85) with \(u^*\) and \(v^*\) replaced by \(Lu^*\) and \(Lv^*\) (for arbitrary \(u\))?</li>

<li>The statement about cohomology and base change needs a flatness hypothesis (\(F\) flat over \(Y\)). Otherwise, it is false.</li>

<li>I believe Proposition 2.42 for \(D^+\), but why does it also work for \(D^b\)? Ah! Truncation.</li>

<li>Remark 1.16 reminded me of Ravi Vakil&rsquo;s mnemonic &rsquo;RAPL&rsquo; (Right Adjoints Preserve Limits). This makes sense because both right adjoints and limits are &ldquo;trying to approximate an object from below.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Why doesn&rsquo;t \(QCoh(X)\) have enough projectives?</li>

<li>Do projective objects restrict to projective objects on open sets? What about injective objects?</li>

<li>At first glance, Corollary 3.15 appears to be saying that the category \(D^b Coh(X)\) is semisimple, but that&rsquo;s of course not true because \(Coh(X)\) is already not semisimple. The catch is that being a direct sum of shifts of cohomology objects is a weaker condition than being a direct sum of simple objects.

<li>It is hard for me to grok the universal property of the derived functor. Can someone decipher it for me?</li>

<li><p>
Does \(Qcoh(\mathbb A^2 - 0)\) have projectives?

<p>
It doesn&rsquo;t have enough projectives; you can see this because products aren&rsquo;t exact. For each \(n>0\) consider on \(\mathbb{A}^2\) the map \(\cal{O}\oplus\cal{O}\rightarrow\cal{O}\) given by the matrix \((x^n,y^n)\). The restriction to \(\mathbb{A}^2-0\) is surjective, but the restriction of the product over \(n\) isn&rsquo;t.
