Conversations in Zulip are organised into topics, and each topic belongs to a &ldquo;channel&rdquo;. You can navigate to topics from the left-hand menu, or search from the search bar at the top.
We will have the following channels.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><code>#maths-questions</code></dt><dd>for any mathematical questions.</dd>
<dt><code>#admin-questions</code></dt><dd>for any questions about class admin, notes/video uploads, scheduling, etc.</dd>
<dt><code>#announcements</code></dt><dd>for announcements. Only class staff will be able to post to this channel. Important announcements will always be on Wattle as well. I recommend that you subscribe to email notifications for this channel.</dd>
<dt><code>#general</code></dt><dd>for everything else.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Zulip has desktop and mobile apps (see <a href="https://zulip.com/apps/">https://zulip.com/apps/</a>), so you can choose how to interact with it. You can also sign up to receive email notifications to messages, and replying to those emails will also automatically post the replies to Zulip.
</p>

<p>
You can get started by briefly introducing yourself in the <code>introductions</code> topic under the <code>#general</code> channel. I have already written an introduction there.

<h2 id="orgbad7dff" class="collapsed"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> How to study for this course?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
There is no single answer to the question &ldquo;How to study <span class="underline">_</span>?&rdquo;&#x2014;everyone learns differently&#x2014;but here are some strategies that are generally helpful.
They are not specific to this course, and should be useful for studying mathematics in general.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgaac94d5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgaac94d5"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Reading</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
I am using &ldquo;reading&rdquo; as a short form form &ldquo;absorbing new mathematics&rdquo;.
It also applies to watching videos.
</p>

<p>
Read actively.
Pause often to think about what you have just read.
Reading maths is slow.
It is closer to reading poetry than reading a novel.
You need to think deeply about every sentence, and it is common for something to take a long time to sink in.
</p>

<p>
What to think while reading?
If you have read a definition, pause and try to construct examples yourself.
Also try to construct non-examples.
After that, create even more examples and non-examples.
Once you feel like you have a rich set of examples and non-examples, continue.
If the text gives some examples and non-examples, read them.
They will undoubtedly enrich your understanding.
If you feel like you do not have a rich set of examples, ask me (or someone else).
</p>

<p>
If you have read a statement (a proposition or a theorem), pause and try to find situations where the statement applies.
What does the statement say in this situation?
Does it say anything surprising?
Try to find other situations.
Also try to find situations where the statement does not apply.
Try to play devil&rsquo;s advocate by finding situations where the statement is wrong.
Assuming the statement is accurate, this will fail, but you will learn a lot from trying.
</p>

<p>
If you have read an explanation (a proof, for example), pause and try to find the key ideas in the explanation.
Try to find a concrete example where the explanation applies, and understand it in that example.
Then repeat with another example.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org6135d0c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6135d0c"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Testing your understanding</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Use the problems you see in lectures, workshops, quizzes, and homework to test your understanding.
After reading a problem, if
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>you understand what exactly is being asked, and</li>
<li>you can think of ways to get started,</li>
</ol>
<p>
then your understanding is good.  
It is not expected that you immediately see how to solve the problem.
But if you are stumped, or unable to get started, then your understanding is incomplete.
In this case, go back to the reading and revisit the related concepts.
</p>

<p>
Do not look at the solution to <i>any</i> problem without having spent sufficient time attempting it on your own.
If you do so, you are wasting a problem (and problems are valuable!).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org07846cb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org07846cb"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Approaching problems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
It is not uncommon to feel stumped after reading a problem.
One reason is that you are not familiar with the relevant ideas.
But even if you are, it can be difficult to get started.
Here are some strategies to get started.
</p>

<p>
Your first attempt does not have to lead to a solution.
So try something and see if it leads anywhere.
A failed attempt will often generate new ideas.
</p>

<p>
The problem will often involve new terminology.
Break it down until you have restated it in terms you are familiar with.
As you get used to the new terminology, this process will get easier.
</p>

<p>
Experiment!
If the problem talks about a number \(n\), experiment by taking small values of \(n\).
If it talks about a graph, try with a some small examples of graphs.
If it talks about a function, test with some functions you know.
This is where it helps to have a handy collection of examples.
</p>

<p>
Try to find the corresponding simplest problem.
If the problem talks about a big number, try the same problem for smaller numbers.
If the problem talks about all graphs, try with some small graphs.

<div id="outline-container-org1e3b9ed" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1e3b9ed" class="collapsed"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Academic integrity policy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Please read the following guidelines carefully. 
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org534595d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org534595d"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Academic integrity policy for assignments</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
While solving your assignments, you will typically work in two phases.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The solving phase: this is when you are actually trying to find the answers to the questions.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>First, you should think about the problem on your own.</li>
<li>Next, you are welcome and encouraged to collaborate with other students while you are in the solving phase. It is often by working productively with peers that you will learn the most. Collaboration means that all of you are thinking about the problem <i>together</i> and coming up with a solution <i>together</i>.
You should move on to the next phase once you know more or less how to solve the problem.</li>
<li>You are encouraged to go to office hour and to the MSI drop-in sessions to get clarifications.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The write-up phase: this consists of writing up your solutions for submission, once you know more or less how to solve the problems.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You must do this entirely by yourself. Work alone when you are writing.</li>
<li>If you collaborate with anyone else, copy (parts of) solutions from someone else, copy from pictures taken of the board, or ask someone else to write your solutions, you are violating the academic integrity policy.</li>
<li>If you get stuck while writing, you can go back to the previous phase to collaborate/ask questions to your instructors, but once again when you are back to writing the solution, it must be done independently.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>


<p>
Additionally, keep in mind the following.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>When you are writing up your solution, you must write down at the top of your solution sheet a list of your collaborators, as well as any external resources you used.
It is a violation of the integrity policy if you do not acknowledge the sources from which you received help.
However, you do not need to cite help received from office hour, demonstrators, or the MSI drop-in session.</li>
<li>Asking someone else to give you the solutions, or paying someone else to give you the solutions, is a violation of the integrity policy. Use of websites such as Chegg, CourseHero, etc for getting assignment solutions is a violation of the integrity policy.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you are ever unsure about whether something is or is not allowed, ask the instructor for clarification.
You will never get into trouble for asking for clarification about what is acceptable.
However, you will face serious consequences if you fail to follow the academic integrity policy.

<li>Gregor Mendel observed a particular gene in garden peas that exists in two types: \(G\) or \(g\).
Each pea plant has a pair of genes.
So a plant could be of type \(GG\), or \(Gg = gG\), or \(gg\).
We take a plant and fertilise it with a plant of type \(Gg\) to produce an offspring.
We do the same process starting with the offspring (always mating with a \(Gg\) plant), and continue.
The offspring inherits one gene from each parent with equal probability.
So, for example, if we fertilise \(GG\) with \(Gg\), then the offspring will be \(GG\) with probability \(1/2\) and \(Gg\) with probability \(1/2\).
If we fertilise \(Gg\) with \(Gg\), the offspring will be \(GG\) with probability \(1/4\), \(Gg = gG\) with probability \(1/2\), and \(gg\) with probability \(1/4\).

The next problems are about constructing machines that do certain things.
Carefully convince each other why your solutions work.
Some of these problems are hard, and take practice to solve. Don&rsquo;t get discouraged if you can&rsquo;t come up with solutions right away!
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Let \(L\) be a language. Consider the following language.
\[L^{del} = \{xz \mid xyz \in L\text{ where }x,z\in \Sigma^*, y \in \Sigma\}.\]
Given an NFA that recognises \(L\), construct an NFA that recognises \(L^{del}\).
</p>

<p>
<i>Hint: In your NFA, at any point once you&rsquo;ve read some portion of the string, you should create the option to ignore one letter and then move on with the calculation.</i>
</p></li>

<li><p>
Let \(L_1\)  and \(L_2\) be languages. Let the <i>perfect shuffle</i> of \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) be the language
\[L = \{w \mid w = a_1 b_1 \cdots a_k b_k, \text{ where } a_1, \dots, a_k, b_1, \dots, b_k \in \Sigma \text{ and } a_1 \cdots a_k \in L_1 \text{ and } b_1 \cdots b_k \in L_2\}.\]
(The number \(k\) can be arbitrary).
As a warm up to understand the construction:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Take \(L_1 = 0^{*}\) and \(L_2 = 1^{*}\), and describe the perfect shuffle \(L\).</li>
<li>Take \(L_1 = \{0,00,000\}\) and \(L_2= \{1,11,111\}\), describe the perfect shuffle \(L\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Now, given automata \(M_1\) and \(M_2\) recognising \(L_1\) and \(L_2\), respectively, construct an automaton \(M\) to recognise \(L\).
You may assume that \(M_1\) and \(M_2\) are deterministic, and construct a non-deteterministic \(M\).
</p>

<p>
Here is a series of pointers to help you come to a complete solution of this problem.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We&rsquo;ll have to somehow combine the DFAs recognising the two languages into a third one.</li>

<li>We&rsquo;ll need to start at the start state of \(M_1\), because we expect the first letter of any valid word to be a letter that&rsquo;s valid at the start of any word in \(L_1\).</li>

<li>Once we read a letter from \(L_1\), we have to &ldquo;pause&rdquo; and read a letter from \(L_2\) in order to be valid. But after that, we&rsquo;ll have to &ldquo;resume&rdquo; in \(M_1\), which means we have to remember where we came from. Can you simulate this using a product-type construction?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>(&lowast;, bonus) If you&rsquo;re finished with the remainder of the worksheet, construct an automaton to recognise the <i>shuffle</i> of two regular languages \(L_1\) and \(L_2\), defined as follows:
\[L = \{w \mid w = a_1 b_1 \cdots a_k b_k, \text{ where } a_1, \dots, a_k, b_1, \dots, b_k \in \Sigma^{*} \text{ are such that } a_1 \cdots a_k \in L_1 \text{ and } b_1 \cdots b_k \in L_2\}.\]</li>

While solving your assignments, you will typically work in two phases.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The solving phase: this is when you are actually trying to find the answers to the questions.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>First, you should think about the problem on your own.</li>
<li>Next, you are welcome and encouraged to collaborate with other students while you are in the solving phase. It is often by working productively with peers that you will learn the most. Collaboration means that all of you are thinking about the problem <i>together</i> and coming up with a solution <i>together</i>.
You should move on to the next phase once you know more or less how to solve the problem.</li>
<li>You are encouraged to go to office hour and to the MSI drop-in sessions to get clarifications.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The write-up phase: this consists of writing up your solutions for submission, once you know more or less how to solve the problems.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You must do this entirely by yourself. Work alone when you are writing.</li>
<li>If you collaborate with anyone else, copy (parts of) solutions from someone else, copy from pictures taken of the board, or ask someone else to write your solutions, you are violating the academic integrity policy.</li>
<li>If you get stuck while writing, you can go back to the previous phase to collaborate/ask questions to your instructors, but once again when you are back to writing the solution, it must be done independently.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>


<p>
Additionally, keep in mind the following.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>When you are writing up your solution, you must write down at the top of your solution sheet a list of your collaborators, as well as any external resources you used.
It is a violation of the integrity policy if you do not acknowledge the sources from which you received help.
However, you do not need to cite help received from office hour, demonstrators, or the MSI drop-in session.</li>
<li>Asking someone else to give you the solutions, or paying someone else to give you the solutions, is a violation of the integrity policy. Use of websites such as Chegg, CourseHero, etc for getting assignment solutions is a violation of the integrity policy.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you are ever unsure about whether something is or is not allowed, ask the instructor for clarification.
You will never get into trouble for asking for clarification about what is acceptable.
However, you will face serious consequences if you fail to follow the academic integrity policy.

<li>Please read the academic integrity policy for assignments.</li>

<li>If you want to justify why, for example, a relation satisfies certain property, you must convince the reader that the property holds for <i>every single</i> element of the relation.
More generally, if you want to justify why certain kinds of objects have a certain property, you have to give a <i>proof</i>, i.e., a convincing argument why the property holds for all possible such objects.</li>

<li>If you want to justify why, for example, a relation does not satisfy a certain property, it is enough to give <i>one example</i> that shows that the property fails. Such an example is called a <i>counterexample</i>.
More generally, if you want to justify why a particular object does not satisfy a particular property, it is enough to give a counterexample.
Note that the counterexample has to be explicit.</li>

<li>In mathematical problems, if you are asked to <i>show</i> something, that is the same as being asked to <i>prove</i> something, which means that you have to give a complete justification. I know that you may not be used to proving things yet, but that&rsquo;s okay. We will learn this as we go. For now, remember that it is your job to convince the reader who is reading your solution, so you have to try your best to explain your answers.</li>

The <i>transitive closure</i> of \(G\) is the graph \(G^+\) with the same vertices as \(G\), but in \(G^{+}\), we have an edge from \(v\) to \(w\) if there is a path in \(G\) from \(v\) to \(w\).
</p>

<p>
Let \(G\) be the graph of the relation \(R = \{(a,b) \mid 0 \leq b - a \leq 2\}\) on the set \(S = \{1,2,3,4\}\).
Draw \(G\) and \(G^+\).
Write down the adjacency matrices of both graphs.
</p></li>
<li><p>
We say that \(G\) is <i>transitive</i> if \(G = G^+\).
Let \(A\) be the boolean adjacency matrix of \(G\).
Prove that \(G\) is transitive if and only if \(A = A + A^{*2}\) (boolean addition).
</p>

<p>
\noindent
<i>Caution:</i> There is no subtraction in boolean arithmetic.  So if \(x+y = x+z\), then you cannot conclude that \(y = z\).
</p></li>

<li>Using the criterion in the previous problem, determine if the following adjacency matrices define transitive graphs:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\)</li>
<li>\(\begin{pmatrix} 1&1&0 \\ 0&1&1 \\ 0&0&1\end{pmatrix}\)</li>
<li>\(\begin{pmatrix} 0&1&1 \\ 0&0&1 \\ 0&0&0\end{pmatrix}\)</li>
</ol></li>

Grundy&rsquo;s game is defined as follows.
The starting position is some number of piles of berries.
A move consists of taking <i>one</i> pile of berries, and dividing it into two non-empty piles of <i>unequal sizes</i>.
For example, a pile of size \(4\) can only be split into \(1/3\), whereas a pile of size \(5\) can be split either as \(1/4\) or as \(2/3\).
The person who can&rsquo;t make a move loses: at this point, the game board will only have piles of sizes either 1 or 2.

<p>
Draw the game graph starting at the position \(6\), labelling each position as either \(N\) or \(P\).
