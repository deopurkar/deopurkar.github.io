<p>
Welcome to algebra 2!  In this course, we will learn use the machinary of abstract algebra to understand numbers, equations, and functions.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Textbook</dt><dd>Algebra (2nd edition) by Michael Artin (Chapters 12, 15, 16).</dd>
<dt>Assessment</dt><dd>5% reflective check-ins, 5% workshop participation, 30% homework, 30% midterm, 30% final.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The weekly workload of the course is as follows:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Reading</dt><dd>I will assign roughly 10 pages to read from Artin.  To guide your reading, I will provide a list of accompanying questions.  As you read, I expect you to solidify your understanding by trying these questions (you do not have to submit, write-up, or present these answers).</dd>
<dt>Reflective check-in</dt><dd>By Tuesday night, you will complete a reflective check-in on Wattle.  It will consist of one question: What part of the reading you found most difficult?  As long as you submit a response, you will get credit (no right or wrong answers).</dd>
<dt>Lectures</dt><dd>Wednesday and Friday&rsquo;s lectures will be about the assigned reading and will focus on the most difficult parts.</dd>
<dt>Workshop</dt><dd>Monday/Tuesday&rsquo;s workshop will be about the content from last week (starting week 2).</dd>
<dt>Homework</dt><dd>Due on Fridays.  Will be on the material from last week (starting week 2).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
If you are enrolled in the 6000-version of the course, in addition to the homework you will complete 2 mini-projects.
The 30% homework weight will be split as 20% homework + 10% mini-projects.
A mini-project will be like an extended homework that goes deeper into some aspect of the course.
</p>

<p>
<b>Collaboration policy</b> :: For the reading, the accompanying questions, and the workshop questions, I encourage you to work with others.  For the homework, please work individually at first and only then work with others.  The write-ups must be your own.  As a matter of academic honesty, please write the names of your collaborators on your submissions (this will have no effect on your marks).
</p>

<p>
<b>Use of computers</b> :: Using computational algebra software is acceptable as long as you can independently justify the answers, and unless explicitly forbidden.  I recommend against consulting large language models (ChatGPT etc) for mathematical questions.  But if you do, you must (a) explicitly acknowledge its use, like listing your collaborator and (b) provide a transcript of the conversation.

<li>How would you prove that \(\sqrt 3 \not \in \mathbf{Q}[\sqrt 2]\)?
The most simple minded way is to prove that for no \(a, b \in \mathbf{Q}\), we have \((a+b\sqrt 2)^2 = 3\).
Here is another way that uses the concept of conjugates.
We say that \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbf{C}\) are <i>conjugates</i> over \(\mathbf{Q}\) if for every \(p(x) \in \mathbf{Q}[x]\), if \(p(\alpha) = 0\) then \(p(\beta) = 0\) and vice versa.
Equivalently, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are conjugates over \(\mathbf{Q}\) if they have the same minimal polynomial over \(\mathbf{Q}\).

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Prove that \(a+b \sqrt 2\) and \(a-b \sqrt 2\) are conjugates over \(\mathbf{Q}\).</li>
<li>Suppose \(\sqrt 3 = a + b \sqrt 2\).
Take \(p(x) = x^2-3\) in the definition of conjugates.
What do you get?
(You should get that \(a = 0\) or \(b = 0\), but \(b = 0 \) is impossible, so \(a = 0\)).</li>
<li>Finally, conclude that there is no rational number \(b\) such that \(\sqrt 3 = b \sqrt 2\).</li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>
Here is a version of the above problem that might help in the homework.
Let \(\zeta_3 = e^{2\pi i/3}\).
For \(a,b,c \in \mathbf{Q}\), prove that \(a + b 2^{1/3} + c 2^{2/3}\) and \(a + b \zeta_3 2^{1/3} + \zeta_3^2 2^{2/3}\) are conjugates over \(\mathbf{Q}\).

Let \(F = \mathbf{F}_2[a]/(a^4+a+1)\).
Note that \(1, a, a^2, a^3\) is a basis of \(F\) as an \(\mathbf{F}_2\) vector space.
So we can represent every element of \(F\) uniquely as \(b_0 + b_1 a + b_2 a^2 + b_3 a^3\), where \(b_0,\dots, b_3 \in \mathbf{F}_2\).

Exercise 15.M.3.
Let us make this question a bit more precise.
What are the possible degrees of the irreducible factors of \(f\) in \(K[x]\)?
That is, for each \(d \in \{1,\cdots, 6\}\), determine whether \(d\) is possible as a degree of an irreducible factor of \(f \in K[x]\).
If you say that a degree \(d\) is possible, please give an example of an \(F\), a \(K\), and an \(f\) such that \(f \in K[x]\) has an irreducible factor of degree \(d\).
If you say that a degree \(d\) is not possible, please explain why.
</p>

<p>
We can ask for a refinement of this question (but you do not have to do this).
The factorisation of \(f \in K[x]\) gives a partition of 6.
For example, if \(f\) factors into two linear factors and two quadratic factors, we have the partition \(6 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2\).
What are the possible partitions of 6?

The goal of this mini-project is to explore the factorisation of prime numbers in cyclotomic rings.
</p>

<p>
Let \(\zeta_n = e^{2\pi i / n}\).
The \(n\)-th <i>cyclotomic ring</i> is the ring \(\mathbf{Z}[\zeta_n]\).
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Let \(p\) be an integer prime number.
Consider the map \(\mathbf{Z}[x] \to \mathbf{Z}[\zeta_p]\) that sends \(x\) to \(\zeta_p\).
Find the kernel of this map.
Justify your answer.</li>

<li>Let \(\ell\) be an integer prime number.
Prove that \(\ell\) is prime in \(\mathbf{Z}[\zeta_p]\) if and only if the polynomial \(x^{p-1} + \cdots + 1\) is irreducible in \(\mathbf{F}_{\ell}[x]\).
For \(p = 5\), give examples of integer primes \(\ell\) that are also primes in \(\mathbf{Z}[\zeta_p]\) and those that are not primes in \(\mathbf{Z}[\zeta_p]\).
(At least 3 examples of each kind).</li>

<li>Suppose \(\ell \neq p\).
Prove that \(x^{p-1} + \cdots + 1\) is reducible in \(\mathbf{F}_{\ell}[x]\) if and only if \(p\) divides \(\ell^{n} - 1\) for some positive integer \(n < p-1\).
Observe (but do not write-up) that this statement is equivalent to: \(x^{p-1}+\cdots+1\) is irreducible in \(\mathbf{F}_{\ell}[x]\) if and only if the order of \(\ell\) in \(\mathbf{F}_{p}^{\times}\) is \((p-1)\).</li>

<li>This problem involves doing experiments using a computer.  You may use a program of your choice (my choice is <code>sage</code>, which has many mathematical algorithms built-in).  Ask me for help if you need it.  
You do not need to prove any of your results.

The goal of this project is to explore the inverse Galois problem.
This problem asks whether given a finite group \(G\), we can find a finite Galois extension \(\mathbf{Q} \subset K\) such that \(\operatorname{Gal}(K/ \mathbf{Q})\) is isomorphic to \(G\).
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Let \(p\) be a prime number and let \(G = \mathbf{Z}/ (p-1) \mathbf{Z}\).
Find an isomorphism
\[ G \to \operatorname{Gal}(\mathbf{Q}(\zeta_p)/ \mathbf{Q}).\]</li>

<li><p>
Let \(n\) be an integer that divides \(p-1\) for some prime number \(p\).
Find a finite Galois extension \(K\) of \(\mathbf{Q}\) such that \(\operatorname{Gal}(K/ \mathbf{Q})\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z} / n \mathbf{Z}\).
</p>

<p>
Given \(n\), there always exists a prime number \(p\) such that \(n\) divides \(p-1\).
So the construction above takes care of all cyclic Galois groups.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Let us explore a more quantitative version of the inverse Galois problem: for polynomials of degree \(n\), how frequently is the Galois group equal to the full symmetric group \(S_n\)?
Gather some numerical data.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Fix \(n\).</li>
<li>Let \(P_{n,N}\) be the set of monic polynomials of degree \(n\) with coefficients in \(\{-N,-N+1, \cdots, N-1, N\}\).
What fraction of the elements of \(P_{n,N}\) have Galois group equal to \(S_n\)?</li>
<li>Does there seem to be a limiting value as \(N \to \infty\)?</li>
<li>In (2), checking all polynomials may be computationally infeasible.
An alternate approach is to pick a large number of samples from \(P_{n,N}\) uniformly randomly, and to calculate the fraction that have Galois group \(S_n\).
If the sample size is large enough, then this fraction should be very close to the value we want.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Based on the data, can you make a conjecture?

<p>
The goal of this workshop is to see the connection between field automorphisms and algebraic relations satisfied by the roots as alluded in the lecture.
</p>

<p>
Let \(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_4\) be the roots of \(x^4-2 = 0\).
Let \(K = \mathbf{Q}[\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_4] \subset \mathbf{C}\).
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Prove that any automorphism of \(K\) must permute the \(\alpha_i\).</li>

<li>Using the above, conclude that we have an injective map \(\operatorname{Aut}(K) \to S_4\).</li>

<li><p>
What is the image of this map?  That is, which permutations of the roots arise from automorphisms of the field?
</p>

<p>
The answer is closely tied to <i>polynomial relations among the roots</i>.
Suppose
\[\alpha_1 = 2^{1/4}, \quad \alpha_2 = 2^{1/4} i, \quad \alpha_3 = -2^{1/4}, \quad \alpha_4 = -2^{1/4}i.\]
Observe that we have the relation \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_3 = 0\) but not the relation \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_{4} = 0\).
Conclude that the polynomial \((34)\) cannot be in the image of \(\operatorname{Aut}(K)\).
</p></li>

<li><p>
Let us find all possible polynomial relations in the roots.
This is simply the kernel of the map
\[ \mathbf{Q}[x_1, \dots, x_4] \to K\]
that sends \(x_i\) to \(\alpha_i\).
Let us ask the computer to find it:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sage"><span style="color: #a0522d;">K</span> = QQ[i+2^(1/4)]
S.&lt;x1,x2,x3,x4&gt; = PolynomialRing(QQ,4)

f.kernel()
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
Ideal (x2 + x4, x1 + x3, x3^2 + x4^2, x4^4 - 2)
</pre>


<p>
Now that you know the kernel, rule out some other permutations.
</p></li>

<li>It is more efficient to find \(\operatorname{Aut} K\) using another presentation.
We have the presentation \(\mathbf{Q}[x,y]/(x^2+1, y^4-2) \to K\) given by \(x \mapsto i\) and \(y \mapsto 2^{1/4}\).
(Assume for now that this map is an isomorphism, and later convince yourselves that this is indeed the case).
Use this presentation to conclude that \(\operatorname{Aut} K\) has 8 elements.
Describe them by how they act on \(i\) and \(2^{1/4}\).
Use this description to pin down the 8 permutations of \(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_{4}\) arising from \(\operatorname{Aut} K\).</li>

<li>Exercise 16.3.2: (b) and (c)</li>

<li><p>
Let \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\) be the four complex roots of the irreducible polynomial \(x^4-4x+2 \in \mathbf{Q}[x]\).
Find the minimal polynomial of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2+\alpha_3\alpha_4\) over \(\mathbf{Q}\).

<p>
For this problem, you may need to rewrite symmetric functions in terms of elementary symmetric functions.  See the workshop for a quick tutorial.

<li>Find the degrees of the splitting fields of:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(x^3-2\) over \(\mathbf{Q}\)</li>
<li>\(x^3-t\) over \(\mathbf{C}(t)\)</li>
</ol></li>

<li>In all the examples above, let \(K/F\) be the splitting field.
Find a nice presentation of \(K\) over \(F\).
(That is, write \(K = F[x_1, \dots, x_n] / I\) for an explicit ideal \(I\).)</li>

<li>We can express any symmetric expression in the roots in terms of the coefficients, which allows us to find its precise value.
For an asymmetric expression, we can find the value up to a finite ambiguity.
Here is an example.
Let \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3\) be the roots of \(f(x) = x^3+2x-2\), and let \(\alpha = \alpha_1\alpha_2-\alpha_3\).
The \(S_3\) orbit of the expression \(x_1x_2-x_3\) contains 2 other expressions: \(x_1x_3-x_2\) and \(x_2x_3-x_1\).
Let \(\beta = \alpha_1\alpha_3 - \alpha_2\) and \(\gamma = \alpha_2\alpha_3-\alpha_1\).

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Prove that \((x-\alpha)(x-\beta)(x-\gamma)\) has coefficients in \(\mathbf{Q}\).</li>
<li><p>
Find these coefficients.  You have then narrowed down \(\alpha\) to 3 possible values.
</p>

<p>
To do this, you will have to rewrite symmetric polynomials in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials.  Here is an example of how to do that in <code>sage</code>.
Remember that you can copy/paste and evaluate sage code at <a href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/">https://sagecell.sagemath.org/</a>.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sage">S.&lt;x,y,z&gt; = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3)
<span style="color: #a0522d;">E</span> = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).elementary()
E.from_polynomial((x*y-z)*(x*z-y)*(y*z-x))  <span style="color: #b22222;">#</span><span style="color: #b22222;">Modify for your polynomial.</span>
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
e[2, 2] - e[3] - 2*e[3, 1] - e[3, 1, 1] + 2*e[3, 2] + e[3, 3] +
2*e[4] + e[4, 1] - 2*e[4, 2] - 5*e[5] + 2*e[5, 1] - 2*e[6]
</pre></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>


<p>
Explanation of notation:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(e[i]\) is the \(i\)-th elementary symmetric polynomial \(e_i\).</li>
<li>\(e[i,j]\) is \(e_i \cdot e_j\), and so on.</li>
<li>Since we only have 3 variables, \(e_{4}\) and above are zero.
So, the expression <code>sage</code> gave reduces to
\[e_2^2 - e_3 - 2 e_3e_1 + e_3e_1^2 +  2 e_3e_2 + e_3^2.\]</li>
</ul>

<p>
You don&rsquo;t have to use <code>sage</code>.  Feel free to use whatever method (including computation by hand).  And, of course, I do not expect you to do this kind of heavy computation on an exam.

The goal of this workshop is to use Galois theory to settle the question of ruler/compass constructions.
We say that \(x \in \mathbf{C}\) is <i>constructible</i> if it lies in a tower of quadratic extensions.
That is, if there exist fields
\[ \mathbf{Q} \subset K_1 \subset K_2 \subset \cdots \subset K_n,\]
where each \(K_i \subset K_{i+1}\) is a degree 2 extension and \(\alpha \in K_n\).
Let us prove the following.
</p>

<p>
\bigskip
</p>

<p>
\noindent
<b>Theorem</b>. A number \(x \in \mathbf{C}\) is constructible if and only if its Galois group (= the Galois group of the splitting field of its minimal polynomial) has order \(2^m\) for some \(m\).
</p>

<p>
\bigskip
</p>

<p>
Let us prove the if part.
Suppose \(z\) is constructible.
It is enough to construct a Galois extension (= splitting field) that contains \(z\) and whose degree over \(\mathbf{Q}\) is a power of 2.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Suppose \(z = \sqrt {2 + \sqrt 3}\).
Construct a Galois extension (= splitting field) that contains \(z\) and whose degree over \(\mathbf{Q}\) is a power of 2.</li>
<li>Do the same for \(\sqrt{2 + \sqrt {3 + \sqrt 5}}\).</li>
<li>Try to formalise the pattern you see.
This is a bit tricky.  
One clean way is to prove the following by induction: there exists field \(K'_i\) containing \(K_i\) such that (a) \(K'_i/ \mathbf{Q}\) is Galois and (b) the degree of \(K'_i / \mathbf{Q}\) is a power of 2.</li>
</ol>


<p>
Let us now try the converse.
Suppose \(z\) lies in a Galois extension of degree \(2^{m}\) over \(\mathbf{Q}\).
Let \(G\) be the Galois group.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Here is a fact from group theory: a group of order \(2^m\) has a subgroup of order \(2^{m-1}\).  Use it to produce a chain of subgroups of size \(1,2,\cdots, 2^m\).</li>
<li>Apply the main theorem of Galois theory.</li>

<dt>Tips for reading</dt><dd>There are no major results from now on.
Everything is a further illustration of the main theorem of Galois theory.
But understanding these helps solidify the main theorem.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>[Theorem 16.8.5] Try to prove the theorem yourself.</li>
<li>[Examples 16.9.2] I find these more confusing than illuminating.
Feel free to skip them.</li>
<li>[Proposition 16.9.5/6] If you understood the cubic, then there is nothing new here.</li>
<li>[Proposition 16.9.8] Again, the proof of this is not much harder than that of Proposition 16.9.5/6.
But this proposition is usable only we can write down the resolvent cubic.
This is possible, in principle, because the coefficients of the resolvent cubic are symmetric expressions in the roots of the original quartic.
You can try to find it yourself or ask the internet.</li>
<li>[Proposition 16.10.2] We have seen examples of this in class already, so hopefully there is nothing surprising here.
It is worth going through a moderately complicated example.
Try reading the \(p = 17\) example in Artin or work out a smaller example by yourself.</li>

<li><p>
A <i>simple</i> group is a group that has no normal subgroups other than the identity and the group itself.
For example, for a prime \(p\), the group \(\mathbf{Z}/p \mathbf{Z}\) is simple, and these are the only simple abelian groups.
There are many non-abelian finite simple groups.
In a massive undertaking in the later half of the last century, many mathematicians working together found out <i>all</i> finite simple groups.
The picture below (from wikipedia) lists them.

Let \(f(x) \in \mathbf{Q}[x]\) be a polynomial whose Galois group over \(\mathbf{Q}\) is a non-abelian simple group \(G\).
