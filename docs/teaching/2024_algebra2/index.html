The in-class quizzes will have an individual and a group component.
You will do a set of questions on your own (15-20 minutes).
You will then do the same set of questions in a small group (15-20 minutes).
I will collect the individual as well as the group answer sheet.
Your mark will be a weighted average (80% individual + 20% group).
</p>

<p>
What is the point of the group component?
Making correct arguments and catching wrong arguments is an essential part of mathematics.
My hope is that you will spend the group component to convince each other of your answers, and in that process, hone your skills of argumentation.

<p>
The first three problems are about <i>nested square roots</i>, namely complex numbers like \(\sqrt{\sqrt 2 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt 3}}\).
More precisely, \(\alpha \in \mathbf{C}\) is a <i>nested square root</i> if there exists a sequence of fields
\[ \mathbf{Q} = F_0 \subset F_1 \subset \cdots \subset F_n\]
such that each \(F_{i+1}/F_{i}\) is a quadratic extension and \(\alpha \in F_{n}\).
A nested square root is also called a <i>constructible number</i> because these are precisely the complex numbers that can be constructed with a ruler and compass, starting with the two points \(0\) and \(1\).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-5-1">
<p>
Some nested square roots can be de-coupled to a linear combination of simple square roots.
For example, we have
\[ \sqrt {5 + 2\sqrt 6} = \sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3.\]
But some cannot be.
Prove that \(\alpha = \sqrt{1 + \sqrt 3}\) cannot be written as a sum
\[ \sqrt{a_{1}} + \cdots + \sqrt{a_{n}}, \quad a_i \in \mathbf{Q}.\]
</p>

<p>
<b>Hint</b>. Compare the Galois group of the minimal polynomial of \(\alpha\) over \(\mathbf{Q}\) and the Galois group of \(\mathbf{Q}[\sqrt{a_1}, \dots, \sqrt{a_n}] / \mathbf{Q}.\)

Let \(G\) be the Galois group of the minimal polynomial of \(\alpha\) over \(\mathbf{Q}\).

<p>
Prove the converse to the problem before: if \(\alpha \in \mathbf{C}\) is such that its minimal polynomial over \(\mathbf{Q}\) has Galois group whose order is a power of 2, then \(\alpha\) is a nested square root.
As an application, show that if \(p\) is a prime number of the form \(2^n+1\), then \(\zeta_p\) is a nested square root.

With this, we have completed a proof of the following.<br />
<b>Theorem</b>. For a prime number \(p\), the regular \(p\)-gon is constructible if and only if \(p\) has the form \(2^n+1\).

In this problem, you may use the following fact from group theory without proof. <br />
<b>Theorem</b>. Let \(p\) be a prime and \(G\) a group of order \(p^{n}\) for \(n \geq 1\).  Then \(G\) contains a normal subgroup of index \(p\).

<p>
\noindent
<b><b>Sketch of the proof</b></b>
</p>

<p>
Follow the same method as in class, keeping track of the field that contains the coordinates of the constructed points.
The starting field will be \(\mathbf{Q}(\cos t, \sin t)\).
The key is to prove that \(\cos (t/3)\) has degree 3 over this field.
It is easier to handle the field \(\mathbf{Q}(\cos t)\), which is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Q}(x)\), the field of rational functions in a variable \(x\).
Over this field, prove that \(\cos(t/3)\) has degree 3.
To do so, you need to prove that a certain polynomial in \(\mathbf{Q}(x)[y]\) is irreducible.
Using the ideas in class, move through irreducibility in \(\mathbf{Q}(x)[y]\), in \(\mathbf{Q}[x,y]\), and \(\mathbf{Q}(y)[x]\).
Finall conclude that over \(\mathbf{Q}(\cos(t), \sin(t))\) also \(\cos(t/3)\) must have degree 3.

Prove that

Consider

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
Let us look more closely at the rings \(\mathbf{Q}[\alpha] \subset \mathbf{C}\), or more generally, rings \(F[\alpha] \subset K\), where \(F \subset K\) are fields.
We will see that it is simpler to study \(\mathbf{Q}[\alpha]\) rather than \(\mathbf{Z}[\alpha]\).
</p>

<p>
The key point was that \(F[\alpha] \subset K\) is the image of the ring homomorphism
\[ \phi \colon F[x] \to K \]
that sends \(F \to K\) by the given inclusion and sends \(x\) to \(\alpha\).
Let \(I \subset F[x]\) be the kernel of \(\phi\).
The first isomorphism theorem gives an isomorphism
\[ F[x]/I \to F[\alpha].\]
So, if we want to understand \(F[\alpha]\), it is critical to understand \(I\).
</p>

<p>
We know that \(I \subset F[x]\) is an ideal.
And fortunately, we know a lot about ideals of \(F[x]\).
Let us recall what we know.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Every ideal of \(F[x]\) is a principal ideal.
In fact, if \(I \subset F[x]\) is an ideal, and if \(f \in I\) is an element of the smallest degree, then \(I = (f)\).</li>
<li>The ideal \((f)\) is contained in the ideal \((g)\) if and only if \(g\) divides \(f\).</li>
<li>The maximal ideals of \(F[x]\) are \((f)\) where \(f\) is an irreducible polynomial.</li>
<li>The prime ideals of \(F[x]\) are the ideal \((0)\) and the maximal ideals as above.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Let us now look at \(I = \mathrm{ker}\phi\).
The ring \(F[x]/I\) is isomorphic to a sub-ring of \(K\), which is a field.
Therefore, \(F[x]/I\) is an integral domain.
So \(I\) is a prime ideal.
</p>

<p>
Now there are two possibilities: 
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(I = 0\) :: In this case, there are no polynomials in the kernel of \(\phi\).
This means that there is no polynomial in \(F[x]\) that vanishes when you substitute \(x = \alpha\).
In this case, we say that \(\alpha \in K\) is <i>transcendental over \(F\)</i>.</li>
<li><p>
\(I = (f)\) where \(f\) is a non-zero irreducible polynomial :: In this case, there is a polynomial in the kernel of \(\phi\).
That is, there is a polynomial in \(F[x]\) that vanishes when you substitute \(x = \alpha.\)
In this case, we say that \(\alpha \in K\) is <i>algebraic over \(F\)</i>.
</p>

<p>
The <i>minimal polynomial</i> of \(\alpha\) or the <i>irreducible polynomial</i> of \(\alpha\) is characterised by any of the following equivalent conditions:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It generates the kernel of \(\phi \colon F[x] \to K\) that sends \(x \to \alpha\).</li>

<li>It is an irreducible polynomial that vanishes when you substitute \(x = \alpha\).</li>

<li><p>
It is a polynomial of the smallest degree that vanishes when you substitute \(x = \alpha\).
</p>

<p>
(Strictly speaking, the conditions determine \(f\) only up to scaling.  To remedy this, we usually take \(f\) to be monic.)

It is easy to see that every polynomial \(f\) has a factorisation into irreducibles (keep factoring until you cannot).  The interesting part is uniqueness.
Suppose
\[ p_1 \cdots p_{n} = q_{1} \cdots q_{m}.\]
Consider \(p_{1}\) on the left.
It suffices to show that there is an \(i\) such that \(q_{i} = p_{1} \cdot u \) for a unit \(u\).
We then cancel \(p_1\) from both sides and continue.
In fact, it suffices to show that there is an \(i\) for which \(p_{1}\) divides \(q_i\) (irreducibility of \(q_i\) implies that the other factor must be a unit).
So the key fact is the following:

Then we can just list all the irreducible polynomials in \(F[x]\) by making a sieve.
We make a list of polynomials up to a given degree, ordered by the degree: linears, quadratics, cubics, &#x2026;
The linears are automatically irreducible.
We take a linear polynomial and cross out every higher degree one that is divisible.
We keep going.
What remains are the irreducible ones.

What if \(R = \mathbf{Q}[x]\)?
Then we cannot sieve because there are infinitely many polynomials of a given degree.
There are algorithmic irreducibility tests (read the end of Section 12.4), but they are a bit involved.
</p>

<p>
Instead of studying them, we will learn a handful of tools that will be enough for most purposes.
</p>

<p>
The key idea is the following.
We have the diagram
\[ \mathbf{Z}/p \mathbf{Z} [x] \leftarrow \mathbf{Z}[x] \rightarrow \mathbf{Q}[x].\]
We understand factorisation on the left.
It turns out that there is not much difference between irreducibility in \(\mathbf{Z}[x]\) versus \(\mathbf{Q}[x]\).
And we can make deductions about factorisation in \(\mathbf{Z}[x]\) by reducing modulo \(p\).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-4-5">
<p>
Let us relate factorisation over \(\mathbf{Q}[x]\) and \(\mathbf{Z}[x]\).
Consider the factorisation
\[ 3x+3 = 3 \cdot (x+1).\]
This is a non-trivial factorisation in \(\mathbf{Z}[x]\) but trivial one in \(\mathbf{Q}[x]\).
This is basically the only difference in the theory.
</p>

<p>
To get rid of factorisations as above, we introduce the following notion.
We say that \(f(x) \in \mathbf{Z}[x]\) is <i>a primitive polynomial</i> if no prime \(p \in \mathbf{Z}\) divides \(f(x)\).
Equivalently, for every prime \(p\), the image of \(f(x)\) in \(\mathbf{Z}/p \mathbf{Z}[x]\) is non-zero.
Equivalently, we cannot extract a non-unit constant factor.
By convention, we also require the leading coefficient of \(f(x)\) to be positive (this is less important; if we don&rsquo;t do this, we have to amend most of the following statements by adding &ldquo;up to sign&rdquo; or &ldquo;up to a unit in \(\mathbf{Z}\)&rdquo;).
</p>

<p>
If \(f(x)\in \mathbf{Z}[x]\) is not primitive, we can simply extract out all primes \(p\) that divide it.
In other words, we can write
\[ f(x) = c g(x)\]
where \(c \in \mathbf{Z}\) and \(g(x)\) is primitive.
</p>

<p>
More generally, if \(f(x) \in \mathbf{Q}[x]\), then we can take a common denominator of all coefficients and write \(f(x) = 1/N \cdot h(x)\) where \(h(x) \in \mathbf{Z}[x]\).
We can then extract a constant factor out of \(h(x)\) if any and get
\[ f(x) = c g(x) \]
where \(c \in \mathbf{Q}\) and \(g(x) \in \mathbf{Z}[x]\) is primitive.
It is easy to check that the expression above is <i>unique</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Slogan</b>: For primitive polynomials, factorisation in \(\mathbf{Q}[x]\) and \(\mathbf{Z}[x]\) behave in the same way.

Suppose \(f(x) = g(x) h(x)\) in \(\mathbf{Z}[x]\) is a non-trivial factorisation.

A fascinating proof is topological, and uses the notion of &ldquo;winding number&rdquo;.

Suppose we have a closed curve in \(\mathbf{C} \setminus 0\), which we encode by a map \(f \colon S^1 \to \mathbf{C} \setminus 0\).
We can define a number \(W(f)\) that counts how many times \(f\) &ldquo;winds around 0&rdquo;.

<b><b>Proposition</b></b> If \(f\) can be continuously deformed into \(g\) while staying in \(\mathbf{C} \setminus 0\) then \(W(f) = W(g)\) .

First, if \(\lambda\) is small, then dog-on-a-leash gives winding number 0.
Second, if \(\lambda\) is huge, then dog-on-a-leash gives winding number \(n\).
But we can continuously move between these by taking \(\lambda\) from a small number to a large number.
This is a contradiction.

By the structure theorem for abelian groups, it is a product of cyclic groups, say
\[ F^{\times} = \mathbf{Z}/m_1 \mathbf{Z} \times \dots \times \mathbf{Z}/ m_n \mathbf{Z}.\]
Let \(m = \operatorname{lcm}(m_1, \dots, m_n)\).
Observe that we have \(q - 1 = m_1 \cdots m_{n}. \)
Then we have \(x^{m+1} = x\) for all \(x \in \mathbf{F}\).
This is a polynomial equation of degree \(m+1\) so it can have at most \(m+1\) solutions.
As a result, we get \(m = q-1\).
But then the \(m_i\) must be pairwise relatively prime (otherwise, their lcm will be smaller than the product).

Conversely, suppose \(s\) divides \(r\).
An element of sub-field of size \(p^s\) in \(F\) must satisfy \(x^{p^s}-x = 0\).

This proves uniqueness.
For the existence, we must prove that this equation does indeed have \(p^s\) distinct roots.
To do so, observe the following fact (true over any field): \(x^a-1\) divides \(x^{b}-1\) if \(a\) divides \(b\).
So \(p^{s}-1\) divides \(p^{r}-1\).
And \(x^{p^s-1}-1\) divides \(x^{p^r-1}-1\).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-9">
<p>
Let \(K/F\) be a finite extension.
We say that \(\alpha \in K\) is a primitive element for the extension if
\[ K = F(\alpha).\]
That is, every element of \(K\) can be written as a polynomial in \(\alpha\) with coefficients in \(F\).
It is useful to know if a primitive element exists because then we have
\[ K \cong F[x]/f(x),\]
where \(f(x)\) is the minimal polynomial for \(\alpha\).
This is a particular simple kind of extension.
</p>

<p>
We have already seen the following theorem.
<b><b>Theorem:</b></b> Let \(K/F\) be an extension of finite fields.  Then a primitive element exists.
<b><b>Proof:</b></b> Just take \(\alpha\) to be a generator of the cyclic group \(K^{\times}\).
</p>

<p>
Our main goal today is to prove the following theorem.
<b><b>Theorem:</b></b> Let \(K/F\) be a finite extension of fields of characteristic 0.  Then a primitive element exists.
</p>

<p>
Since \(K/F\) is finite, we already know that there exist finitely many \(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_{m}\) such that
\[ K = F[\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_m].\]
The point is that one \(\alpha\) is enough.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Example:</b></b> Take \(K = \mathbf{Q}[\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3]\).  Then \(\alpha = \sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3\) is a primitive element.
</p>

<p>
In my opinion, the primitive element theorem sounds more useful than it is in practice.
In practice, it is often more useful to know \(K = F[\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_m]\) for a big \(m\) rather than \(m = 1\).
Because in that case, we can easily break up the extension into smaller sub-extensions. 
If \(K = F[\alpha]\), it is less obvious if it can be broken up.

Before we begin, let us collect a few useful facts that we already know.
Fix fields \(F \subset K\).
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Proposition</b></b> Suppose we have \(f(x), g(x) \in K[x]\) that actually lie in \(F[x]\).
Then their (monic) gcd \(\gcd(f,g)\) also lies in \(F[x]\).
<b><b>Proof</b></b> There are many ways to see this.  The most direct is to observe that the gcd can be computed by Euclid&rsquo;s algorithm, which will never leave \(F[x]\) if it starts with two polynomials in \(F[x]\).
Another way is to use that \(\gcd(f,g)\) can be written as \(f(x) a(x) + g(x) b(x)\) for \(a(x), b(x) \in F[x]\).
</p>

<p>
The next observation is about repeated roots and derivatives.
<b><b>Proposition:</b></b> If \(\gcd(f, f') = 1\), then \(f\) has no repeated roots in \(K\).
</p>

<p>
Note that if \(f(x) \in F[x]\), then \(f'(x) \in F[x]\) and so the gcd will also live in \(F[x]\).
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Corollary:</b></b> If \(f\) is irreducible in \(F[x]\) and \(f' \neq 0\), then \(f\) has no repeated roots in \(K\).
<b><b>Proof</b></b>: If \(f\) is irreducible in \(F[x]\), and \(f' \neq 0\), then \(f' \in F[x]\) has lower degree than \(f\).
So \(\gcd(f,f')\), which lies in \(F[x]\), must be 1.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Corollary</b></b>: If \(f\) is irreducible and \(F\) is of characteristic 0, then \(f\) has no repeated roots in \(K\).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-9-2">
<p>
To be frank, the statement of the primitive element theorem is more important than the proof.
Even within the proof, the statement of the claim below is more important than the rest of the details.
It gives an explicit construction of a primitive element.
</p>

<p>
It suffices to prove that \(K = \mathbf{F}[\alpha, \beta]\) has a primitive element (we then induct).
Let \(f,g \in F[x]\) be min polys of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\).
Choose an extension \(L / K\) in which both \(f\) and \(g\) split completely.
(If you want to keep things concrete, imagine \(F = \mathbf{Q}\) and \(L = \mathbf{C}\) or \(\overline{\mathbf{Q}}\).)
Then \(f\) and \(g\) split into <i>distinct</i> factors.
Let \(\alpha_i \in L\) be the roots of \(f\) and \(\beta_j \in L\) the roots of \(g\).
Say \(\alpha = \alpha_1\) and \(\beta = \beta_1\).
</p>

<p>
We prove that for all but finitely many \(\lambda \in F\), the element \(\gamma = \alpha + \lambda \beta\) is a primitive element.
More precisely, choose \(c \in F\) such that the elements
\[ \gamma_{ij} = \alpha_i + c \beta_j\]
are all distinct.
(This excludes only  finitely many \(c\), and since our field \(F\) is necessarily infinite, leaves infinitely many choices.)
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Claim</b></b> With \(c\) chosen as above, \(\gamma\) is a primitive element for \(K = F[\alpha,\beta]\).
</p>

<p>
We now prove the claim.
Let \(M = F[\gamma] \subset K\).
We want to prove that \(M = K\).
It is enough to prove that \(\alpha \in M\); because then \(\beta = (\gamma - \alpha)/c \in M\) and so \(M = K\).
</p>

<p>
To prove that \(\alpha \in M\), we prove that the minimal polynomial \(h(x)\) of \(\alpha\) over \(M\) has degree 1.
To see this, observe that we can write down two polynomials in \(M[x]\) satisfied by \(\alpha\), namely \(f(x)\) and also \(g((\gamma - x)/c)\).
Then \(h(x)\) divides both of them.
Both \(f(x)\) and \(g(\gamma - cx)\) split completely over \(L\).
But see that they only have one common root: namely \(\alpha = \alpha_1\).
Indeed, the roots of \(f(x)\) are \(\alpha_i\) and the roots of \(g((\gamma - x)/c)\) are \(\gamma - c \beta_{j}\).
We have
\[ \alpha_i = c\beta_j - \gamma\]
if and only if
\[  \alpha_i + c\beta_j = \gamma,\]
which happens only for one \(i\) and \(j\), namely \(i = 1\) and \(j = 1\).
(This is because we chose \(c\) very carefully.)
So \(f(x)\) and \(g((\gamma - x)/c)\) cannot have a common factor of degree &gt; 1 in \(L\).
It follows that \(\deg h = 1\).

Here is an example of a field extension without a primitive element.
It has to be in characteristic \(p\), and it has to be over an infinite field.
So take \(F = \mathbf{F}_p(x,y)\) and let \(K = F[u,v]/(u^p-x, v^p-y)\).
This is the field obtained by adjoining the \(p\)-th roots of \(x\) and \(y\).
</p>

<p>
You can do it in sequence, if you want. 
That is, let \(K_1 = F[u]/(u^p-x)\)&#x2014;and verify somehow that \(u^p-x\) is irreducible in \(F[u]\).
And then \(K = K_1[v]/(v^p-y)\)&#x2014;and again verify somehow that \(v^p-y\) is irreducible in \(K[v]\).
</p>

<p>
Then \(\deg(K/F) = p^2\).
But note that the \(p\)-th power of any element of \(K\) lies in \(F\).
So no element of \(K\) has degree \(p^2\) over \(F\).
As a result, there is no primitive element.

For us, a function field means a finite extension of \(\mathbf{C}(t)\).
We can view the elements of \(\mathbf{C}(t)\) as functions on the complex plane \(\mathbf{C}\) (minus a finite set of points).
We can view elements of a field extension as function on a different space, which we now construct.
It turns out that the algebra of function field is equivalent to the topology of these spaces; we make this precise later.
</p>

<p>
By the primitive element theorem, every finite extension of \(\mathbf{C}(t)\) is isomorphic to
\[ \mathbf{C}(t)[x]/f_t(x)\]
for some irreducible \(f_t(x) \in \mathbf{C}(t)[x]\).
By multiplying by a suitable polynomial in \(t\) and taking out any common factors, we can arrange so that \(f_t(x)\) lies in \(\mathbf{C}[t,x]\) and is furthermore primitive (not divisible by any non-constant polynomial in \(t\)).
Then \(f_t(x)\), which we also denote as \(f(t,x)\), is irreducible in \(\mathbf{C}[t,x]\).
From now on, we work with extension of \(\mathbf{C}(t)\) given explicitly as
\[ K_{f} = \mathbf{C}(t)[x]/f_t(x)\]
where \(f_t(x) = f(t,x)\in \mathbf{C}[t,x]\) is irreducible.
The degree of the extension is the \(x\)-degree of \(f\).

Suppose we have two such extensions \(K_f / \mathbf{C}(t)\) and \(K_g / \mathbf{C}(t)\).

For most values of \(t\), we expect \(f_t(x)\) to have \(n\) distinct roots.
This is indeed what happens.
In fact, more is true.
Let \(\pi \colon S(f) \to \mathbf{C}\) be the projection.

<b><b>Theorem:</b></b> There exists a finite set \(B \subset \mathbf{C}^2\) such that 
\[ \pi^{-1}(\mathbf{C} -B) \to \mathbf{C}-B\]
is a connected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_space">\(n\)-sheeted covering space</a>.
</p>

<p>
The finite set is not unique&#x2014;we can always enlarge it and the statement still holds.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Definition</b></b> An \(n\)-sheeted <i>branched cover of \(\mathbf{C}\)</i> is a connected covering space of \(\mathbf{C} - B\) for some finite set \(B\).
</p>

<p>
The set \(B\) is unimportant.
We can always enlarge it and we treat the resulting covering space as representing the same branched cover.
</p>

<p>
Consider two branched covers represented by covering spaces \(S_1 \to \mathbf{C}^2-B\) and \(S_2 \to \mathbf{C}^2-B\).
A <i>map of branched covers</i> is a continuous map \(f \colon S_1 \to S_2\) that commutes with the projections to \(\mathbf{C}^2-B\).
That is, it maps a point of \(S_1\) lying over \(t\) to a point of \(S_2\) lying over the same \(t\).
</p>

<p>
The construction \(K_f \mapsto S(f)\) gives us a procedure
\[ \text{Field extension of } \mathbf{C}(t)  \to \text{Branched cover of } \mathbf{C}.\]
A map of field extensions yields a map of corresponding branched covers (in the other direction)!
</p>

<p>
To see how, suppose we have a map \(\phi \colon K_g \to K_f\).
Suppose \(\phi(x) = h(t,x)\).
Then
\[ (t,x) \mapsto (t, h(t,x))\]
gives a map from \(S(f) \to S(g)\).
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Example</b></b>
Take \(f(t,x) = x^6-t(t+1)^{2}\) and \(g(t,x) = x^2 - t\).
Then we have a map \(K_g \to K_f\) given by \(x \mapsto x^3/(t+1)\).
We have an induced map \(S(f) \to S(g)\) given by
\[ (t,x) \mapsto (t,x^3/(t+1)).\]
See that if \((t,x)\) lies on \(S(f)\) then the image indeed lies on \(S(g)\).
</p>

<p>
A remarkable theorem is that the correspondence above is an equivalence.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Theorem</b></b> (Riemann Existence Theorem):
The procedure above is an equivalence (&ldquo;equivalence of categories&rdquo;).
This means that this procedure is (1) a bijection between isomorphism classes of extensions \(K_f / \mathbf{C}(t)\) and branched covers \(S(f) \to \mathbf{C}\)  (2) a bijection between maps of field extensions and maps of the corresponding branched covers.
</p>

<p>
In short, studying field extensions of \(\mathbf{C}(t)\) is equivalent to studying branched covers of \(\mathbf{C}\)!
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Remark</b></b>: Given a branched cover, it is not at all clear how to find the polynomial \(f\).  Simalarly, given a map of branched covers it is not at all clear why it should be induced by an algebraic map.  This is the hard part in the theorem.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-10-3">
<p>
Covering spaces are characterised by their monodromy.
This is a simple, beautiful, and ubiquitous geometric concept.th)
Let \(\pi \colon X \to Y\) be an \(n\)-sheeted covering space (for us \(Y\) will be \(\mathbf{C}^2 - B\)).
Fix a basepoint \(y \in Y\), and label its pre-image in \(X\) by \(1,2,\dots,n\).
Take a walk \(\gamma\) in \(Y\) starting at \(y\) and coming back to \(y\).
After we choose a starting point in \(X\) from \(1,\dots, n\), there is a unique way to lift this walk up to \(X\).
This is because \(X \to Y\) is a covering space, so the pre-image of a small neighborhood in \(Y\) consists of \(n\) disjoint copies of the same neighborhood.
We just have to continue in whatever copy we are in!
</p>

<p>
The following picture (\(y = p^{*}\)) shows this in an example.
</p>

<div id="org045477c" class="figure">

</p>
</div>

<p>
The lift may not return to the starting point, but it must return to one of \(1, \dots, n\).
We thus get a permutation \(p_{\gamma}\) of \(1,\dots, n\).
The map \(\gamma \mapsto p_{\gamma}\) is called the <i>monodromy</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Theorem</b></b> \(p_{\gamma}\) depends only on the homotopy class of \(\gamma\).
</p>

<p>
That is, a continuous perturbation of \(\gamma\) does not change \(p_{\gamma}\).
</p>

<p>
Let us consider \(Y = \mathbf{C}^2 \setminus B\).
Choose a system of curves \(\gamma_{i}\) as shown below (the crosses are points of \(B\)):
</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/Course_notes/2023-03-24_14-58-52_screenshot.png" alt="2023-03-24_14-58-52_screenshot.png" />
It turns out that up to homotopy, any curve in \(\mathbf{C}-B\) is a concatenation of \(\gamma_i\)&rsquo;s or their reverses.
So, to specify the monodromy, it suffices to specify the permutations \(p_i\) associated to each \(\gamma_{i}\).
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Theorem</b></b> Given any permutations \(p_1, \dots, p_{b}\), there is a covering space of \(\mathbf{C}-B\) (unique up to isomorphism) whose monodromy is \(\gamma_{i} \mapsto p_i\).
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Proof (sketch)</b></b> 
We choose half rays starting at each cross and extending to infinity.
We cut the plane open along these rays, and stack \(n\) copies of these cut planes on top of each other.
We label the copies \(1,\dots, n\).
The monodromy tells us exactly how to glue these sheets together along the cut edges (see picture).

<img src="assets/Course_notes/2023-03-24_15-09-45_screenshot.png" alt="2023-03-24_15-09-45_screenshot.png" />
(Caution: The result may not be connected.  To ensure it is, we must be able to go from any \(i\) to any \(j\) by a repeated application of \(p_1, \dots, p_{b}\) and their inverses.  But this is a minor point.)

Galois theory provides a link
\[

which generalises the idea of monodromy (and completely bypasses the topology, which we may not have!).
We can thus answer many questions about field extensions using properties of permutation groups.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-11">
<p>
Galois theory arose from our efforts to understand solutions to algebraic equations.
More precisely, it arose from the following question: suppose we have an equation
\[ x^{n} + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + a_{0} = 0.\]
How do we express solutions (roots) of this equations in terms of the coefficients?
</p>

<p>
For linear equations, there is essentially nothing to do.
For a quadratic equation,
\[ x^2 + bx + c\]
we have a formula
\[ x = (-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4c})/2.\]
For cubics and quartics, there is also a formula.
For quintics, people tried for a long time to find a formula but could not.
Later, the work of many people culminated in proving that a formula like this cannot exist!

For simplicity, let us take our coefficients to be in \(\mathbf{Q}\).
Suppose \(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n\) are the roots.
Let \(F = \mathbf{Q}[\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n] \subset \mathbf{C}\).
This \(F\) is called the <i>splitting field</i> of the polynomial.
We would like to describe the field extension
\[ \mathbf{Q} \subset \mathbf{Q}[\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n].\] 
In particular, we want to know if we can arrive at this extension by a sequence of easier extensions like
\[ K \subset K[a^{1/n}].\]

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-11-3">
<p>
Let us consider
\[ \mathbf{Q} \subset F = \mathbf{Q}[\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_{n}].\]
The main insight of Galois theory is that the nature of this extension is controlled by symmetries among the roots \(\alpha_{1}, \dots, \alpha_n\) (to be made precise).
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Key Observation</b></b>: Let \(\phi\) be an automorphism of the field extension \(F / \mathbf{Q}\), that is, an automorphism \(\phi \colon F \to F\) that restricts to the identity on \(\mathbf{Q}\).
Then \(\phi\) permutes \(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n\).
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Key insight</b></b>: Not all permutations of \(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n\) arise from automorphism \(\phi\).
But if we understand which ones do, then we understand the nature of the field extension.
</p>

<p>
Let \(\operatorname{Aut}(F / \mathbf{Q})\) be the group of automorphisms of \(F/\mathbf{Q}\).
By the observation above, we have a homomorphism
\[ \operatorname{Aut}(F / \mathbf{Q} ) \to S_{n}\]
Since the \(\alpha_i\) generate \(F\), the only automorphism that fixes all \(\alpha_{i}\) is the identity.
That is, the homomorphism above has trivial kernel, so it is injective.
The <i>Galois group</i> of the polynomial \(x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+ \dots +a_{0}\) is the image of the homomorphism above.
By the first isomorphism theorem, it is an isomorphic copy of \(\operatorname{Aut}(F / \mathbf{Q} )\).
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Theorem</b></b>. (Main theorem of Galois theory):
There is a bijective correspondence between fields sandwiched in \(\mathbf{Q} \subset F\) and subgroups of the Galois group.
</p>

<p>
We will what the bijection is in due course. 
Here, let us explain how to go from a subgroup to a subfield:
\[ H \leadsto F^H = \{x \in F \mid h(x) = x \text{ for all } h \in H\}.\]
</p>
</div>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org622a6b5"></a>Example<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-5-11-3-1">
<p>
Consider the polynomial \(x^4-10x^2+1\).
Its roots are
\[ \alpha_1 = \sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3, \alpha_2 = \sqrt 2 - \sqrt 3, \alpha_3 = -\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3, \alpha_4 = -\sqrt 2 - \sqrt 3.\]
What are the automorphisms \(\phi \colon F / \mathbf{Q} \to F / \mathbf{Q}\)?
We note that
\[ F = \mathbf{Q}[\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3] \cong \mathbf{Q}[x]/(x^2-2) [y]/(y^2-3) = \mathbf{Q}[x,y]/(x^2-2,y^2-3).\]
Thus, specifying a map \(F \to F\) is equivalent to
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>specifying the map on \(\mathbf{Q}\)</li>
<li>specifying the images of \(x\) and \(y\) that satisfy the equations \(x^2-2 = 0\) and \(y^2-3 = 0\).</li>
</ol>
<p>
We have no freedom in (1). 
For (2), we may choose to send \(x \to \pm \sqrt 2\) and \(y \to \pm \sqrt 3\).
So \(\operatorname{Aut} F/ \mathbf{Q} \) consists of 4 elements.
These 4 elements permute the \(\alpha_{i}\)&rsquo;s by the following permutations
\[ id, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23).\]
</p>

<p>
It is not hard to see that \(\operatorname{Aut}(F/\mathbf{Q})\)  is isomorphic to \(\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}_2\).
We can take the isomorphism to be
</p>
\begin{align*}
(\sqrt 2 \mapsto -\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3 \mapsto \sqrt 3) &\leftrightarrow (1,0) \\
(\sqrt 2 \mapsto \sqrt 2, \sqrt 3 \mapsto -\sqrt 3) &\leftrightarrow (0,1) \\
(\sqrt 2 \mapsto - \sqrt 2, \sqrt 3 \mapsto -\sqrt 3) &\leftrightarrow (1,1).

Then \(F = \mathbf{Q}[2^{1/3}, \zeta_3].\)
What are the automorphisms \(F/\mathbf{Q}\to F/\mathbf{Q}\)?
To find those, it is best to write \(F\) as a quotient:
\[ F = \mathbf{Q}[x,y]/(x^3-2, y^2+y+1)\]
(why is this true?).
We see that \(F / \mathbf{Q}\) has 6 automorphisms, so the map

Our goal is to understand how to go from coefficients to roots.
Towards this goal, let us first understand how to go from roots to coefficients.
This leads to a theorem that is important in itself.
</p>

Consider
\[ x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_{0} = (x-\alpha_1) \cdots (x-\alpha_n).\]

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-12-4">
<p>
Let us keep a running example, say \(n = 3\) and \(p = u_{1}^3+u_{2}^3+u_{3}^{3}\).
We will prove existence.  Uniqueness is less important (and follows from the same proof).
</p>

<p>
We use a double induction: on \(n\) and on the degree of \(p\).
There is not much to prove for \(n = 1\).
Assume the statement for \(n-1\) and for all polynomials of degree smaller than \(p\).
Consider \(p(u_{1}, \dots, u_{n-1},0)\).
This is symmetric in \(u_{1}, \dots, u_{n-1}\), and by the inductive hypotheses, can be written as a polynomial in \(s_{1}(u_{1}, \dots, u_{n-1}), \dots, s_{n-1}(u_{1}, \dots, u_{n-1})\), say
\[ p(u_{1}, \dots, u_{n-1}, 0) = h(s_{i}(u_{1}, \dots, u_{n-1})).\]
</p>

<p>
In our case,
\[p(u_{1},u_{2}, 0) = u_{1}^{3}+u_{2}^3 = s_{1}^{3}-3s_{1}s_{2}.\]
</p>

<p>
We now take the expression for \(p(u_{1}, \dots, u_{n-1}, 0)\) in terms of \(s_{i}(u_{1}, \dots, u_{n-1})\), and replace \(s_{i}(u_{1}, \dots, u_{n-1})\) by \(s_{i}(u_{1}, \dots, u_{n-1}, u_{n})\).
That is, we consider
\[ q = h(s_{i}(u_{1}, \dots, u_{n})).\]
</p>

<p>
In our case,
\[ q = (u_{1}+u_{2}+u_{3})^3 - 3(u_{1}+u_{2}+u_{3})(u_{1}u_{2} +u_{2}u_{3} + u_{1}u_{3}) = u_{1}^{3}+u_{2}^{3}+u_{3}^{3} - 3u_{1}u_{2}u_{3}. \]
</p>

<p>
We now consider the difference
\[ p(u_{1}, \dots, u_{n}) - q(u_{1}, \dots, u_{n}).\]
There is no reason that this is zero (we are lucky if it is!).
But by construction, it is zero if we substitute \(u_{n} = 0\).
That is, the difference is divisible by \(u_{n}\).
But see that the difference is symmetric!
So it must be divisible by \(u_{1}, \dots, u_{n}\), and hence by their product!
So
\[ p-q = u_{1}\cdots u_{n} r(u_{1}, \dots, u_{n}),\]
where \(r\) is also symmetric.
But \(r\) has smaller degree, so it can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials.
As a result, so can \(p\).
</p>

<p>
In our case, \(r = 3\), so there&rsquo;s nothing to do.

<b>Theorem</b> Let \(K/F\) be a splitting field of \(f(x)\).
Suppose \(g(x) \in F[x]\) is an irreducible polynomial that has a root in \(K\).
Then \(g(x)\) splits into linear factors in \(K[x]\).

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org723ef44"></a>Proof<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-5-13-4-1">
<p>
Let
\[ f(x) = (x-\alpha_{1}) \cdots (x-\alpha_{n})\]
in \(K[x]\).
Let \(\beta \in K\) be a root of \(g(x)\).
Then we can write
\[ \beta = p(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_{n})\]
for some polynomial \(p\) with coefficients in \(F\).
</p>

<p>
It will be good to keep a running example, say \(n = 3\) and
\[ \beta = \alpha_{1}^2 + \alpha_{2}.\]
For every permutation \(\sigma\) of \(\alpha_{1}, \dots, \alpha_{n}\), let
\[ \beta^{\sigma} = p(\alpha_{\sigma(1)}, \dots, \alpha_{\sigma(n)}).\]
Take the collection
\[ B = \{\beta^{\sigma} \mid \sigma \in S_{n}\}.\]
</p>

<p>
In our example,
\[ B = \{\alpha_{1}^2+\alpha_{2}, \alpha_{1}^2+\alpha_{3}, \alpha_{2}^2+\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}^2+\alpha_{3}, \alpha_{3}^2+\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{3}^2+\alpha_{2}\}.\]
</p>

<p>
Let
\[ G(x) = \prod_{\sigma}(x-\beta^{\sigma}) \in K[x].\]
Here is the crucial observation: the polynomial \(G(x)\) is unchanged if we permute the \(\alpha_{i}\)&rsquo;s.
That is, every coefficient of \(G(x)\) is unchanged if we permute the \(\alpha_{i}\)&rsquo;s.
By the Symmetric Function Theorem, every coefficient of \(G(x)\) can be written as an expression in the elementary symmetric polynomials of \(\alpha_{i}\), which are the coefficients of \(f(x)\), and they lie in \(F\).
So \(G(x)\) actually lies in \(F[x]\).
</p>

<p>
But \(\beta\) is a root of \(G(x)\), and \(g(x) \in F[x]\) is the minimal polynomial of \(\beta\).
So \(f(x)\) must divide \(G(x)\).
In \(K[x]\), the polynomial \(G(x)\) splits into linear factors, so \(f(x)\) must also split.

<b>Lemma</b> Let \(K_1/F\) and \(K_2/F\) be finite extensions.
There exists a finite extension \(K/F\) such that contains isomorphic copies of \(K_1/F\) and \(K_2/F\).

It suffices to construct a finite extension \(K/F\) together with maps \(K_1/F \to K/F\) and \(K_2/F \to K/F\).  We can take \(K_i'\) to be the images of these maps.

<p>
Let us first assume that we are in characteristic 0, so that we have the primitive element theorem.
Let \(\alpha \in K_1\) be such that \(K_1 = F[\alpha]\).
Let \(f(x) \in F[x]\) be the minimal polynomial of \(\alpha\).
Let \(K/K_2\) be an extension in which \(f(x)\) has a root, say \(\beta\).
Then we have a map
\[ F[\alpha]/F \to K/F\]
given by \(\alpha \mapsto \beta\).
</p>

<p>
<img src="assets/Splitting_fields/2023-04-26_09-46-58_screenshot.png" alt="2023-04-26_09-46-58_screenshot.png" />
The proof is then complete.
</p>

<p>
Caution: The extension \(K/K_2\) is not necessarily \(K_2[x]/f(x)\), because \(f(x) \in K_2[x]\) need not be irreducible.  It will be \(K_2[x]/g(x)\) where \(g(x)\) is an irreducible factor of \(f(x)\).  
</p>

<p>
Without the primitive element theorem, we have to the same thing repeatedly.
In other words, we induct on \(\deg K_1/F\).
If the degree is \(1\), we are done: just take \(K = K_2\).
Otherwise, choose \(\alpha \in K_{1}\) that is not in \(F\).
Let \(f(x) \in F[x]\) be the minimal polynomial of \(\alpha\).
Let \(K_2'/K_2\) be an extension in which \(f(x)\) has a root, say \(\beta\).
Then we have a map
\[ F[\alpha]/F \to K_{2}'/F\]
given by \(\alpha \mapsto \beta\).
So we have the following diagram:

The main theorem tells us if we can decompose a big extension into a series of smaller extension.
(The analogy behind the title is that we want to climb from the base field up to the splitting field.  The intermediate fields provide footholds like those on a climbing wall.)
If we know enough about the intermediate steps, we can explicitly describe the algebraic structure of elements in the splitting field.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-15-1">
<p>
Let \(K = \mathbf{Q}[\zeta]\) where \(\zeta = e^{2\pi i/5}\) and \(F = \mathbf{Q}\).
Then \(K/F\) has degree 4 and it is the splitting field of
\[ x^{5} - 1.\]
It is also the splitting field of
\[ x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1,\]
which is in fact the minimal polynomial of \(\zeta\).
</p>

<p>
Let \(G = \operatorname{Aut}(K/F)\).
An element of \(G\) is determined by where it sends \(\zeta\).
Furthermore, it must send \(\zeta\) to a root of its minimal polynomial.
So there are only 4 possible elements of \(G\) corresponding to
\[ \zeta \mapsto \zeta^{i}\]
for \(i = 1,2,3,4\).
But since \(K/F\) is Galois, we know that it has 4 automorphisms.
As a result, all 4 choices must give valid automorphisms.
</p>

<p>
The map
\[ i \mapsto \text{The automorphism that sends } \zeta \to \zeta^{i}\]
gives an isomorphism of groups
\[ \mathbf{Z}/ 5 \mathbf{Z}^{\times} \to G.\]
The group on the LHS is cyclic of order 4, generated by \(2\) for example, so the Galois group is also cyclic of order 4.
Henceforth, we identify these two groups.
</p>

<p>
The diagram of subgroups of \(G\) is:
</p>

<div id="org6772a3d" class="figure">

</p>
</div>



<p>
So, by the main theorem, the diagram of intermediate fields is: 
</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/Course_notes/2023-05-03_16-40-15_screenshot.png" alt="2023-05-03_16-40-15_screenshot.png" />
Observe that each step in this tower is a quadratic extension, and hence is obtained by adjoining a square root.
As a result, \(\zeta\) can be expressed in terms of two iterated square roots.
</p>

<p>
Let us dig deeper and find an explicitl such expression for \(\zeta\).
As a first step, let us identify the extension \(L\).
By the main theorem, \(L\) is the fixed field of the subgroup \(\{1,4\}\).
The element \(1\) corresponds to the identity automorphism, which fixes everything.
So \(L\) is the fixed field of the automorphism corresponding to \(4\), which  sends \(\zeta \to \zeta^{4}\).
This automorphism sends
</p>
\begin{align*}
a_0 + a_1 \zeta + a_2 \zeta^2 + a_{3}\zeta^3 &\mapsto a_0 + a_1 \zeta + a_2 \zeta^{3} + a_3\zeta^2 \\
&= (a_0-a_1) - a_1\zeta + (a_3-a_1)\zeta^2 + (a_2-a_1)\zeta^3.
\end{align*}
<p>
In the last line, we used 
\[ \zeta^4 = -1 - \zeta - \zeta^2 -\zeta^3.\]
We see that for this element to be fixed, we must  have
\[ a_1 = 0 \quad\text{and} \quad a_2=a_3. \]
So \(L\) consists of elements of the form
\[ a_{0} + a_2(\zeta^2+\zeta^3),\]
where \(a_0,a_2 \in \mathbf{Q}\).
Set \(\alpha = \zeta^2+\zeta^3\).
Then
\[ L = \mathbf{Q}[\alpha].\]
</p>

<p>
We still haven&rsquo;t found out which square root we need to adjoin to get \(L\).
To do so, we find the minimal polynomial for \(\alpha\) over \(\mathbf{Q}\).
We can do it as before&#x2014;find a relation between powers of \(\alpha\).
But using automorphisms, we can do better (as we did using Frobenius).
The roots of the minimal polynomial are (by definition) the conjugates of \(\alpha\) over \(\mathbf{Q}\).
We have the following.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Proposition</b></b> Let \(K/F\) be a Galois extension with Galois group \(G\).
The \(F\)-conjugates of \(\alpha \in K\) are the precisely the elements in the \(G\)-orbit of \(\alpha\).
In other words, if \(\{\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_{n}\}\) is the \(G\)-orbit of \(\alpha\), then
\[ f(x) = (x-\alpha_1) \cdots (x-\alpha_{n})\]
is the minimal polynomial for \(\alpha\) over \(F\).
</p>

<p>
(Proof sketch: We see that \(f(x)\) is fixed by \(G\) so lives in \(F[x]\).
So the minimal polynomial must divide \(f(x)\).
On the other hand, every \(\alpha_i\) must be a root of the minimal polynomial for \(\alpha\).
So \(f(x)\) is the minimal polynomial.
This is Theorem 16.5.2(a) in <i>Artin</i>).
</p>

<p>
Coming back to our situation, the conjugates of \(\alpha\) are
\[ \alpha = \zeta^2 + \zeta^3 \text{ and } \beta = \zeta + \zeta^4.\]
So the minimal polynomial for \(\alpha\) is
</p>
\begin{align*}
   (x-\alpha)(x-\beta) &= x^2 + x - 1.
\end{align*}
<p>
(In the calculation, we use \(1+\dots+\zeta^4 = 0\)).
So, we get 
\[ \alpha = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]
In particular,
\[ L = \mathbf{Q}[\sqrt 5].\]
</p>

<p>
Finally, to write \(\zeta\), we find its minimal polynomial over \(L\).
Let us again use the conjugates.
Since \(\operatorname{Aut}(K/L) = \{1,4\}\), the \(L\)-conjugates of \(\zeta\) are
\[ \zeta \text{ and } \zeta^4.\]
So the minimal polynomial of \(\zeta\) over \(L\) is:
\[ (x-\zeta)(x-\zeta^4) = x^2 + (\alpha+1) x + 1.\]
(In the calculation, we use \(1+\dots+\zeta^4 = 0\)).
So we arrive at an explicit equation for \(\zeta\) using iterated square roots:
</p>
\begin{align*}
\zeta &= \frac{-1-\alpha \pm \sqrt(\alpha^2+2\alpha-3)}{2} \\
\alpha &= \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\end{align*}

<p>
The key observation is the following.
<b>Claim</b>. Suppose \(L/F\) is Galois and \(g \in \operatorname{Aut}(K/F)\).  Then \(g\) sends all elements of \(L\) to \(L\).
<b>Proof</b>. Take \(\alpha \in L\).  Let \(f(x) \in F[x]\) be the minimal polynomial of \(\alpha\).  Then \(g(\alpha) \in K\) must be a root of \(f(x)\).  Since \(L/F\) is Galois, it is a splitting field, so it contains all roots of \(f(x)\). 
</p>

<p>
We now prove one direction: if \(L/F\) is Galois, then \(H = \operatorname{Aut}(K/L)\) is a normal subgroup.
Let \(h \in H\) and \(g \in G\).
We need to show that \(g^{-1} h g \in H\).
That is, we need to show that \(g^{-1} h g\) fixes \(L\).
Take \(\alpha \in L\).
By the claim, we have \(g(\alpha) \in L\); so \(h\) fixes \(g(\alpha).\)
That is, we have
\[ h g (\alpha) = g(\alpha). \]
But this is equivalent to
\[ g^{-1}h g(\alpha) = \alpha.\]
Since \(\alpha \in L\) was arbitrary, we have proved that \(g^{-1} h g\) fixes \(L\).
</p>

<p>
Let us prove the other direction.
Recall that \(L = K^{H}\) is the fixed field of \(H\).
Suppose \(H \subset G\) is normal.
Again, the key observation is the converse to the above claim.
<b>Claim</b>. Suppose an intermediate field \(L\) has the property that for all \(g  \in \operatorname{Aut}(K/F)\), the element \(g\) sends \(L\) to itself.  Then \(L/F\) is Galois.
<b>Proof</b>. We prove that \(L/F\) is a splitting field.  Take \(\alpha \in L\) primitive over \(F\) with minimal polynomial \(f(x)\).  Since \(K/F\) is Galois, \(f(x)\) splits completely over \(K\).  It is enough to prove that all the roots of \(f(x)\) actually lie in \(L\).  But the roots of \(f(x)\) are of the form \(g(\alpha)\) for \(g \in G\).  Since \(g\) sends \(L\) to itself, we see that \(g(\alpha) \in L\).
</p>

<p>
We now prove the other direction.
Take \(g \in G\) and \(\alpha \in L\).
We need to show that \(g(\alpha) \in L\).
But \(L\) is the fixed field of \(H\); so we need to show that \(g(\alpha)\) is fixed by all \(h \in H\).
That is, we need to show that
\[ h g (\alpha) = g(\alpha),\]
or equivalently
\[ g^{-1}h g(\alpha) = \alpha.\]
But note that \(g^{-1}h g \in H\) because \(H \subset G\) is normal, so the last equation holds because all elements of \(H\) fix \(\alpha \in L\).

<b>Proposition</b>. We have a surjective homomorphism
\[ \operatorname{Aut}(K/F) \to \operatorname{Aut}(L/F)\]
whose kernel is \(H = \operatorname{Aut}(K/L).\)
</p>

<p>
<b>Proof</b>. The most non-obvious point is the existence of the homomorphism.  Given \(g \in \operatorname{Aut}(K/F)\), we would like to restrict it to obtain an element of \(\operatorname{Aut}(L/F)\).  For an arbitrary \(L\), there is no reason to believe that \(g\) sends \(L\) to itself, so the restriction does not make sense.  But if \(L/F\) is normal, then it does (by one of the claims we just proved).  So we indeed get a restriction map
\[ \operatorname{Aut}(K/F) \to \operatorname{Aut}(L/F).\]
Its kernel consists of the automorphisms of \(K\) that fix \(L\), that is, \(\operatorname{Aut}(K/L)\).
It is not immediately clear why it is surjective, but if we look at the sizes of the three groups, we see that it must be surjective.

<li><a id="orgdbe1a89"></a>How might the computer be doing this?<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-5-17-1-1">
<p>
I do not know exactly how the computer does it.
But here is a procedure that works in principle.  
It is probably not optimal (and I am not going to explain all the details), but whatever.
</p>

<p>
At the heart of the problem is finding all maps \(K \to K\) (restricting to the identity of \(F\)).
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Step 1</dt><dd><p>
Express \(K\) as a quotient ring.
</p>

<p>
There are two ways to do this. 
</p>

<p>
In the first, we pick an \(\beta \in K\) that is a primitive element
over \(F\).  We then have a surjection \(F[x] \to K\) that sends \(x
       \to \beta\).  Its kernel is generated by the minimal polynomial of
\(\beta\), say \(g(x)\).  We then get an isomorphism \[ F[x]/g(x)
       \to K.\] Although this is more efficient in terms of the number of
variables, I find the next approach conceptually easier.
</p>

<p>
Instead of picking a primitive element, work with the given
generators \[ K = F[\alpha_{1}, \alpha_n].\] We have a surjective
map \[ F[x_1,\dots,x_n] \to K\] where \(x_{i} \mapsto \alpha_i\).
This map will have a kernel.  For example, the polynomials
\(f(x_{i})\) will be in the kernel.  But there may be other
polynomials in the kernel.  We can interpret a polynomial in the
kernel as <i>an algebraic relation among the roots</i>.
</p>

<p>
The kernel is an ideal, and every ideal of a polynomial ring is
finitely generated.  That is, there is a finite list of polynomials
such that any other polynomial in the kernel is a linear
combination.  For all but the smallest examples, it is humanly
impossible (at least impossible for me), to figure out a set of
generators.  But this is something that a computer can do!  There
are known algorithms for finding kernels of homomorphisms.
</p>

<p>
So, say the computer finds the kernel \[ I = \langle
       h_{1}(x_1,\dots,x_{n}), \dots, h_{m}(x_1,\dots, x_{n})\rangle.\] We
have an isomorphism \[ F[x_1,\dots, x_n] / I \to K.  \]
Remember that this isomorphism sends \(x_{i}\) to \(\alpha_{i}\).
</p></dd>

<dt>Step 2</dt><dd><p>
Profit!
</p>

<p>
Equipped with the quotient presentation, it is now trivial to find the Galois group.
Give me a permutation of the roots, say \(\alpha_i \to \alpha_{p(i)}\).
We want to know whether it defines a valid automorphism
\[ K \to K. \]
It suffices to check whether it defines a valid ring homomorphism.
We use our quotient presentation, and change the domain to
\[ F[x_1,\dots,x_n]/I,\]
where
\[ I = \langle h_1(x_1,\dots,x_{n}), \dots, h_{m}(x_1,\dots,x_n)\rangle.\]
Then we want to know whether \(x_i \mapsto \alpha_{p(i)}\) is a valid ring homomorphism.
But we know exactly when this holds: if and only if all the elements of \(I\) map to 0.
That is, if and only if, for all \(i\), we have
\[ h_i(\alpha_{p(1)}, \dots, \alpha_{p(n)}) = 0.\]
Again, this is something that a computer can check!
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>
In conlusion, with algorithms to handle ring homomorphisms (kernels etc.), a computer can compute Galois groups.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-17-2">
<p>
Let me emphasise that we (at least, I) can compute Galois groups by hand only for easy polynomials.
Easy means either low degree or of a special form.
</p>

<p>
The basic principle of how we compute Galois groups by hand is not too far from the general procedure above.
</p>

<p>
<b>The basic principle</b>. Suppose we have an algebraic relation among the roots, that is, a polynomial in \(F[x_1, \dots, x_n]\) that is satisfied when substitute \(\alpha_{i}\) for \(x_i\).  Then any element of the Galois group must preserve that relation.

<li><a id="org0f8eae7"></a>Example of a cubic<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-5-17-2-1">
<p>
Let us revisit the cubic in light of the above understanding.
Take
\[ f(x) = x^3-3x-1\]
over the base field \(F = \mathbf{Q}\).
Let \(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3\) be the three roots.
</p>

<p>
Experience (work of our ancestors) tells us that it is a good idea to look for a relation of the form
\[ (\alpha_1-\alpha_2)(\alpha_2-\alpha_3)(\alpha_3-\alpha_1) = d\]
(if possible) where \(d \in F\).
Unfortunately, without knowing the roots, I cannot compute the LHS.
But fortunately, when we square the LHS, it becomes symmetric, and hence a polynomial in the coefficients, which I know!
\[ \mathrm{LHS}^2 = 4 \cdot 3^3 - 27 \cdot 1 = 81.\]
So we must have
\[ (\alpha_1-\alpha_2)(\alpha_2-\alpha_3)(\alpha_3-\alpha_1) = \pm 9.\]
I do not know the exact sign, but it does not matter.
Either way, I have found an algebraic relation among the roots.
</p>

<p>
I now conclude that the only allowable permutations are the even permutations, because otherwise the LHS will not be preserved.

<li><a id="org45de8ba"></a>Back to the general discussion<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-5-17-2-2">
<p>
Without knowing the roots, it is difficult to find algebraic relations among them.
We get around this using the following idea.
</p>

<p>
<b>Finding relations</b>. Try to find relations among roots indirectly by using symmetric polynomials, which can be evaluated entirely in terms of the coefficients.
</p>

<p>
The discriminant is a great example.
For the quartic, there is another one called the resolvent cubic.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-17-3">
<p>
We start with a general result.
</p>

<p>
<b>Proposition</b>. Let \(F\) be a field of characteristic 0 and let \(f(x) \in F[x]\) be irreducible of degree \(n\). Let \(K/F\) be the splitting field of \(f(x)\) and \(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n \in K\) the roots of \(f(x)\).  Then the roots form one orbit under the Galois group \(G\).
</p>

<p>
<b>Proof (sketch)</b>.  If the roots formed two orbits, then taking the product of \((x-\alpha)\) over one orbit and over the other orbit gives two polynomials fixed by \(G\) whose product is \(f(x)\).  Polynomials fixed by \(G\) have coefficients in \(F\), so this gives a non-trivial factorisation of \(f(x)\).  For three or more orbits, we do the same thing; we get even more factors.
</p>

<p>
A subgroup \(G \subset S_n\) under which \(\{1,\dots, n\}\) forms only one orbit are called <i>transitive</i>.
Up to re-numbering there are only a handful of transitive subgroups of \(S_4\):
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(S_4\)</li>
<li>\(A_4\)</li>
<li>\(D_4\)</li>
<li>\(C_4 = \langle (1234) \rangle\)</li>
<li>\(D_{2} = V = \{(), (12)(34), (14)(23), (13)(24)\}\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
The key principle in finding the Galois group by hand is the following.
</p>

<p>
<b>Principle</b> Find a polynomial relation \(R\) in the roots \(\alpha_i\) with coefficients in \(F\).
</p>

<p>
For example, \(\alpha_2^2 = 3\alpha_2\) is a relation.
A relation \(R\), by itself, gives no information.  
But if \(R\) is a relation, and \(p\) is a permutation, we can look at the relation \(R'\) obtained by permuting the roots according to \(p\).
</p>

<p>
<b>Idea</b>. If the relation \(R'\) does not hold then \(p\) cannot be in the Galois group.
</p>

<p>
If \(R\) is a symmetric relation, then \(R' = R\), so we get no information.
The key is to find non-symmetric relations.
</p>

<p>
The trouble is that it is difficult to compute values of non-symmetric expressions.
But we can compute them indirectly!
It&rsquo;s best to see this in an example.
</p>
</div>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="orgb3cd161"></a>Example<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-5-17-3-1">
<p>
Let \(f(x) = x^3 + 36x + 63\) over the base field \(F = \mathbf{Q}\).
Let the 4 complex roots be \(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_{4}\).
I have the relation
\[ \alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_4 = 63\]
but that is useless to get any restrictions on the Galois group, because it is a symmetric relation.
We need to find non symmetric relations.
</p>

<p>
I propose that we find the value of the non-symmetric expression
\[ \beta_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4.\]
But how?
The key is to also consider
\[ \beta_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,\]
and
\[ \beta_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.\]
Observe that the coefficients of the polynomial
\[ g(x) = (x-\beta_1)(x-\beta_2)(x-\beta_3)\]
are symmetric expressions in the \(\alpha_i\), and hence, can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of \(f(x)\).
The \(g\) polynomial is called the <i>resolvent cubic</i> of the quartic \(f\).
If
\[f(x) = x^4 + a_3x^3+a_2x^2+a_1 x + a_0\]
then the resolvent cubic is
\[g(x) = x^3 -a_2x^2 + (a_1a_3-4a_0)x + (4a_0a_2-a_1^2-a_0a_3^2). \]
(Don&rsquo;t worry; you do not have to memorise this.)
</p>

<p>
In our case, the resolvent cubic factors:
\[ g(x) = (x-18)(x+6)(x+12).\]
So we get <i>three</i> non-symmetric relations
</p>
\begin{align*}
\alpha_1\alpha_{2} + \alpha_3\alpha_4 &= 18\\
\alpha_1\alpha_{3} + \alpha_2\alpha_4 &= -6\\
\alpha_1\alpha_{4} + \alpha_2\alpha_3 &= -12
\end{align*}
<p>
(possibly after renumbering the roots).
This is fantastic! 
It tells that any \(p \in G\) must preserve all three expressions on the left!
It turns out that the only \(G\) that has this property is \(G = V\).
We are done!
</p>

<p>
Even if we were not so lucky,  the resolvent cubic tells a lot.
If it had one rational root, it would give one relation, say
\[ \alpha_1\alpha_{2} + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = r \in \mathbf{Q},\]
and the other two evaluate to irrational numbers.
Then, any \(p \in G\) must fix the above expression on the left.
</p>

<p>
If the resolvent has no roots, that is, is irreducible, that is still good news!
Note that \(F[\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3] \subset K\) is an intermediate field that is the splitting field of the resolvent cubic.
This splitting field has degree 3 or 6, and its presense in \(K\) tells us that \(G\) must have a normal subgroup of index 3 or 6, as the case may be.

</p>

<p>
We now turn to the problem that spurred the field of Galois theory.
</p>

<p>
<b>Question</b>. Given a polynomial \(f(x)\), can we express its roots as nested surds of the coefficients?
</p>

<p>
A nested surd, or a nested radical, is an expression of the form
\[ \sqrt[11]{\sqrt[3]{1 - \sqrt{2}} + \sqrt[5]{11}}.\]
</p>

<p>
More precisely, let \(K/F\) be a field extension. 
We say that an element \(\alpha \in K\) is a <i>nested radical</i> over \(F\) if there is a sequence of subfields
\[ F = F_{0} \subset F_1 \subset \cdots F_{n}\]
with \(\alpha \in F_n\) such that \[F_{i+1} = F_{i}[a_i]\] where some power of \(a_{i}\) lies in \(F_{i}\).
</p>

<p>
So a more precise version of the question above is:<br />
<b>Question</b>. Given \(f(x) \in F\), consider the roots of \(f(x)\) in the splitting field.  Are they nested radicals over \(F\)?
</p>

<p>
We know that the answer is yes for polynomials of degree up to 4.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem</b>. There exist quintic polynomials \(f(x) \in \mathbf{Q}[x]\) whose complex roots are not nested radicals over \(\mathbf{Q}\).
</p>

<p>
The theorem is often stated as: there is no &ldquo;formula&rdquo; for the roots of quintic polynomials.  We have to understand this to mean &ldquo;an expression in terms of radicals&rdquo;.

</p>

<p>
At the heart of Kummer&rsquo;s theorem is the following linear algebra fact, which is only sketched in the notes.  Here is the full story.
</p>

<p>
Let \(F\) be a field of characteristic 0 containing all \(p\)-th roots of unity.
Let the \(p\)-th roots of unity be \(1, \zeta, \dots, \zeta^{p-1}\).
</p>

<p>
<b>Proposition</b>.  Let \(K\) be an \(F\) vector space of finite dimension and let \(\sigma \colon K \to K\) be an \(F\)-linear map different from the identity such that \(\sigma^p = 1\).  Then there exists a \(\sigma\) eigenvector \(b \in K\) whose eigenvalue is \(\zeta^i\) for \(i \neq 0 \pmod p\).  That is, there exists a non-zero \(b \in K\) and \(i \neq 0 \pmod p\) such that
\[ \sigma (b) = \zeta^i b.\]
</p>

<p>
This is pure linear algebra.  There are many ways to prove this result.  Here is one that is different from that in <i>Artin</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Proof</b>. The equation
\[ X^p - 1 = (X-1)(X-\zeta)\cdots(X-\zeta^{p-1})\]
remains true if we substitute a matrix for \(X\).
When we do so, we have to interpret the scalars as scalar matrices.
For example, \(\zeta\) means the matrix \(\zeta \cdot I\).
As a result, the equation is also true for linear maps.
So we get
\[ \sigma^p - I = (\sigma - I)(\sigma - \zeta I) \cdots (\sigma - \zeta^{p-1}I).\]
On the right, we have to interpret the product as composition.
Since \((\sigma - I)\) is non-zero but \((\sigma^p - I)\) is zero, the product
\[ (\sigma - \zeta I) \cdots (\sigma - \zeta^{p-1}I) \]
cannot be invertible.
As a result, one of the factors, say \((\sigma - \zeta^iI)\), is not invertible.
But then it must have a non-zero kernel.
A non-zero \(b\) in the kernel satisfies the property we want.

Let \(f, g \in F[x]\) and let \(K / F\) be a splitting field of \(fg\).
Inside \(K\), the ring generated by the roots of \(f\) is a splitting field of \(f\) and similarly for \(g\).
Call these \(K_f\) and \(K_g\), respectively.
Note that both \(K_f/F\) and \(K_g/F\) are Galois.
We have restriction maps

Let us recall the theorem again.
<b>Theorem</b>. Let \(f(x) \in F[x]\) be irreducible with splitting field \(K/F\).  The following are equivalent.

<li>A root of \(f(x)\) is a nested radical over \(F\).</li>
<li>All roots are</li>
<li>\(G = \operatorname{Aut}(K/F)\) is solvable.</li>

<p>
We will prove the theorem under the assumption that \(F\) contains all \(p\)-th roots of unity for all \(p \leq \deg K\).
Let us also assume that \(F\) is a subfield of \(\mathbf{C}\).
We can then make all our constructions within \(\mathbf{C}\) and it also makes it easier to talk about \(p\)-th roots.
Neither of these are serious restrictions.
</p>

<p>
2 implies 1 is clear.
</p>

<p>
3 implies 2 is also fairly easy.
Suppose \(G\) is solvable.
Consider a filtration
\[ 1 = G_{0} \subset G_{1} \subset \cdots \subset G_{n} = G\]
where \(G_{i} \subset G_{i+1}\) is normal and the quotient is cyclic of prime order.
(The primes are necessarily less that the order of \(G\).)
Consider the corresponding chain of fields
\[ K  = K_{n} \supset K_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset K_{0} = F.\]
Then \(K_{i} \subset K_{i+1}\) is a Galois extension with Galois group cyclic of prime order.
By Kummer&rsquo;s theorem, \(K_{i}\) is obtained by adjoining a \(p\)-th root.
So all elements of \(K\), in particular all the roots of \(f(x)\), are nested radicals.
</p>

<p>
Let us prove that 1 implies 3.
1 says that we have a tower of fields
\[ F = F_{0} \subset F_{1} \subset \cdots \subset F_{n}\]
obtained by adjoining \(p\)-th roots and \(F_n\) contains  a root of \(f(x)\).
The problem is that \(F_{n}/F\) need not be Galois.
To remedy this, we take the given tower and convert it to a tower of fields which are Galois over \(F\).
</p>

<p>
We construct fields \(K_i\) such that
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(F_i \subset K_i\)</li>
<li>\(K_i / F\) is Galois</li>
<li>\(\operatorname{Aut}(K_{i+1}/K_{i})\) is a subgroup of a product of cyclic groups of order \(p\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
To get started, we set \(K_{0} = F\) and \(K_1 = F_1\).
Let us think about constructing \(K_{2}\).
We know that \(F_2\) is obtained from \(F_{1}\) by adjoining a \(p\)-th root, say a \(p\)-th root of \(a\).
