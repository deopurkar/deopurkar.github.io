#+title: Algebra 3 (Algebraic geometry)
#+options: *:t

**This is the website of the course taught in 2019.** 

Welcome to Algebra 3!
This year, algebra 3 will be algebraic geometry.
We will study the geometry of subsets of the affine or projective space defined by the vanishing of polynomial equations, or in other words, (quasi)-projective varieties.

Some [[file:AGFinalPractice.pdf][more practice problems]], in addition to the [[file:AGMidtermPractice.pdf][previous practice problems]].

  *Some students correctly observed that Problem 2 can be done very easily, even without using that Z is a projective variety. Yes! I miscalculated its difficulty.*

* Outline
Here is a preliminary outline of the course. It is undergoing changes as the class progresses, so the later weeks may not be accurate.
I will also upload my lecture notes and the workshop handouts here.

1. Week 1: [[file:AGWeek01.pdf][Lecture Notes 1]]  
  What is algebraic geometry?, 
  Affine space, closed (algebraic) subsets of affine space.

2. Week 2: [[file:AGWorkshop01.pdf][Workshop 1]], [[file:AGWeek02.pdf][Lecture Notes 2]]   
  The ring of regular functions.
  The ideal associated to a subset of affine space.
  The nullstellensatz and consequences.
  (Shafarevich 1.2.2, Shafarevich A.9, Gathmann 1.2)

3. Week 3: [[file:AGWorkshop02.pdf][Workshop 2]], [[file:AGWeek03.pdf][Lecture Notes 3]]   
  Regular maps between affine algebraic sets, isomorphisms.
  Category of affine algebraic sets = Category of nilpotent-free, finitely generated algebras.
  Quasi-affine varieties.
  (Shafarevich 1.2.3, [[file:Danilov-quasi-affine.pdf][Danilov]])

4. Week 4: [[file:AGWorkshop03.pdf][Workshop 3]], [[file:AGWeek04.pdf][Lecture Notes 4]]   
  Definition of abstract algebraic varieties.
  Projective and quasi-projective varieties.
  (Shafarevich 1.4.1, 1.4.2, [[file:Danilov-varieties.pdf][Danilov]])

5. Week 5 [[file:AGWorkshop04.pdf][Workshop 4]], [[file:AGWeek05.pdf][Lecture Notes 5]]  
  Regular functions and regular maps on quasi-projective varieties. Veronese and Segre embeddings.

  [[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/891109/factoring-homogeneous-polynomials-in-two-variables][Math Stackexchange answer]] explaining how homogeneous polynomials in X, Y of degree d factor into d homogeneous linear factors. As a result, they have at most d zeros on P<sup>1</sup>.

6. Week 6 [[file:AGWorkshop05.pdf][Workshop 5]], [[file:AGWeek06.pdf][Lecture Notes 6]]  
  Continued from last week. Separatedness. Segre embedding.

* Prerequisites
Algebra 1 and algebra 2.
Some knowledge of commutative algebra will help, but is not required.

* Lectures and workshops
1. Lecture on Wednesday, 12:00 to 13:00 in Hancock 2.27  
2. Lecture on Thursday, 9:00 to 10:00 in Hayden Allen G051  
3. Lecture on Friday, 12:00 to 13:00 in Hancock 2.27  
4. Workshop on Monday, 11:00 to 12:00 in Hanna Neumann 1.58 (starting week 2).

I will have office hours on Wednesday from 1 to 2, on Thusday from 10 to 11, and at other times by appointment.

* Assessment
There will be weekly homework assignments, a mid-semester exam, and a final exam.	The exams will be worth 20% each (total 40%) and the assignments will be worth 6.66% each (total 60%). Submit your assignments through wattle by following the "submit" link as a single pdf file (handwritten and scanned or typed). Of the 10 assignments, I will drop the lowest score.

* Policies
** Collaboration
You are allowed, even encouraged, to work with others on assignments, but you must write up your solutions *on your own*. In other words, you *may not* copy someone else's write-up and you *may not* write your solutions side by side someone else. On your submission, you must write the names of your collaborators. This is a matter of academic honesty; it will not affect your marks. 

** Late assignments
I will grant extensions only for medical emergencies with a medical certificate. In accordance with the ANU policy, late assignments will incur a 5% penalty per working day. I will not accept any assignments later than a week. To mitigate the strict late policy, I will drop the lowest assignment score.
