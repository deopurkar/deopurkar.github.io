<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>For my papers and preprints, see my <a href="/research/">research</a> page.  </p>

<p>I am an algebraic geometer with broader interests in algebra, geometry, representation theory, and number theory. My focus area is the study of moduli spaces: moduli of curves, branched covers, surfaces, and so on. A lot of my research is about questions of a classical flavor, but the answers often involve modern machinary like deformation theory and stacks.  </p>

<p>Before coming to UGA, I was a Ritt Assistant Professor at <a href="http://math.columbia.edu/">Columbia</a>, and before that I was a graduate student of Joe Harris at <a href="http://math.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a>.  </p>

<p>Just after graduate school, I wrote a <a href="/interests.html">rough non-technical explanation</a> of my doctoral research, which might interest or amuse you.</p>

<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>

<p>I am (co)-organizing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The FIRST talks (Fairly Informal Research Seminar and Tea) at UGA (Mon 2–3).</li>
  <li>SWAG (Summer Workshop in Algebraic Geometry) at UGA (Aug 26–29, 2016).</li>
  <li>AIM workshop on <a href="http://aimath.org/workshops/upcoming/stabmoduli/">Stability and moduli spaces</a> (Jan 9–13, 2016).  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, I go to the Algebraic Geometry, Algebra, and Number Theory seminars at UGA.  </p>

<p>I recently spoke in the ICERM workshop on <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/topical_workshops/tw16-4-ms/">Cycles on moduli spaces, geometric invariant theory, and dynamics</a>.  </p>

<p>In the near future, I am speaking in the Algebraic Geometry Seminar at Georgia and at South Carolina.</p>

<h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2>

<p>This semester, I am teaching Math 2250 (Calculus 1 for scientists and engineers).  </p>

<p>Here are the notes from the course <a href="/moduli/">moduli of curves</a>, which I taught at Columbia.  </p>

<p>For othr courses taught in the past, see my <a href="/teaching/">teaching</a> page.</p>
