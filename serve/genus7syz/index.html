      This page describes ongoing work on the birational model of \(M_7\) constructed as the GIT quotient of the first syzygy points following <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6101">this paper</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Here is what we know so far about the stability of the first syzygy points of canonical genus 7 curves.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A generic curve is <em>stable</em>. Therefore, the GIT quotient is birational to \(M_7\).
      <li>A general tetragonal curve is stable.
      <li>A Casnati&ndash;Ekedahl special tetragonal curve is strictly semistable. All such curves have the same syzygy point.
    </ul>

    <p>
      Here is a <a href="genus7syz.pdf">write up</a> that includes the proofs of the results above (except the proof of the stability of a general tetragonal curve&mdash;that's coming soon.)
      It uses the following two pieces of Macaulay2 code: <a href="mcsyzygy.m2">mcsyzygy.m2</a> (written by David Swinarski) and <a href="delPezzo6.m2">delPezzo.m2</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The complete description of the GIT quotient and its relation to \(\overline{M}_7\) will be very intrictate.
      I welcome any suggestions and contributions towards this goal.
      The next natural questions would be:
      <ul>
	<li>Is a general tetragonal curve stable?
	<li>What are the replacements of trigonal curves?
	<li>What are the replacements of hyperelliptic curves?
	<li>How is the syzygy model related to the Mukai model?
      </ul>
    </p>
