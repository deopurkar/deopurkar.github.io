## Research

For my papers and preprints, see my [research](research/) page.  

I am an algebraic geometer with broader interests in algebra, geometry, representation theory, and number theory. I study moduli spaces: moduli of curves, branched covers, surfaces, and so on. A lot of my research is about questions of a classical flavor, but the answers often involve modern machinery like deformation theory and stacks.  

Before coming to UGA, I was a Ritt Assistant Professor at [Columbia](http://math.columbia.edu/), and before that I was a graduate student of Joe Harris at [Harvard](http://math.harvard.edu/).  

Just after graduate school, I wrote a [rough non-technical explanation](interests/) of my doctoral research, which might interest or amuse you.

## Activities

I am (co)-organizing:

1. FIRST (Fairly Informal Research Seminar and Tea) at UGA (Mon 2:20--3:20).
2. SWAG (Summer Workshop in Algebraic Geometry) at UGA (Aug 26--29, 2016).
3. AIM workshop on [Stability and moduli spaces](http://aimath.org/workshops/upcoming/stabmoduli/) (Jan 9--13, 2016).

In Spring 2016, Johan de Jong and I organized the [Columbia Graduate Student Algebraic Geometry Seminar](research/seminar16/) on the decomposition of the diagonal.  

I go to the Algebraic Geometry, Algebra, and Number Theory seminars at UGA.  

I recently spoke in the ICERM workshop on [Cycles on moduli spaces, geometric invariant theory, and dynamics](https://icerm.brown.edu/topical_workshops/tw16-4-ms/). In the near future, I am speaking in the Algebraic Geometry Seminar at Georgia and at South Carolina.

## Teaching

This semester, I am teaching Math 2250 (Calculus 1 for scientists and engineers).  

Here are the notes from the course [moduli of curves](teaching/moduli/), which I taught at Columbia.  

For other courses taught in the past, see my [teaching](teaching/) page.
