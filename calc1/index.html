    <p>The final exams have been graded and the scores are on CourseWorks.
      If you would like to look at your exam, come to my office today.
      The average for the final was 69 and the standard deviation was 24.

      The final exam will be cumulative with a slight bias towards the last third of the course.
      This means that it will cover Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.1, except the sections that we skipped.
      The skipped sections are 1.4, 2.4, 3.7, 3.8, 3.11, 4.2, 4.5, and 4.6.

    <p>
      Homework will be announced on the website every Thursday and it will be due by the next Thursday by 5pm in the drop box on the 4th floor of the Math builting.
      <em>I will not accept any late homework.</em>
      However, I understand that you may not be able to do some of the homeworks due to extenuating circumstances.
      As a solution, I will drop the two lowest homework scores.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Collaboration</h3>
    <p>
      You may work on the homework in groups, but you must write up the solutions on your own.
      As a matter of academic honesty, write the names of your collaborators on top of your submitted work.
      This will not affect your grade. </p>

    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p> We will study differential and a bit of integral calculus with applications. 
      We will cover the first five chapters (plus a few sections of Chapter 6) in the course textbook.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Functions and Models (Chapter 1)</li>
      <li>Limits and derivatives (Chapter 2)</li>
      <li>Differentiation rules (Chapter 3)</li>
      <li>Applications of Differentiation (Chapter 4)</li>
      <li>The integral (Chapter 5)</li>
      <li>Applications of the integral (Chapter 6 &#8212; a few sections)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here is a more detailed <a href="#plan">course plan</a>.</p>
    <p>For more information, visit the department-wide <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/programs-math/undergraduate-program/calculus-classes/calculus-i/">Calculus 1</a> webpage.

      
    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>
      The final grade will be based on homework (20%), two in-class midterm exams (20% each), and a final exam (40%).
      The exams are scheduled as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Midterm 1: February 17
      <li> Midterm 2: April 9
      <li> Final (projected): May 12 for the 10:10 section, May 14 for the 8:40 section.
    </ul>

    <h2>Resources</h2>

    <h3>Help room</h3>
    <p>
      The math help room, located at Milbank 333 on the Barnard campus, is an excellent resource to get help and foster collaboration.
      It will be staffed by TAs in the math department, all eager to help you.
      Here is the <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/general-information/help-rooms/333-milbank/">staffing schedule</a>.</p>
    <h3>WebAssign</h3>
    <p>
      Although WebAssign is not a required part of the course, you can use it for practice problems.
      If you have WebAssign access, use the class key <code>columbia 7395 4958</code>.</p>
